Check PBI´s against the list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development<br><br>After every session we do a retrospective where we summarize the session.

We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2. Maybe use frameworks like user story mapping<br><br>3. Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1.

Allow AI to read the tasks<br><br><br>This is a great initiative that will systematize and automate the process of turning feature ideas into well-structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks). Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...) "<br>Grant Secure Database Access<br><br>Custom GPT must be allowed to execute database operations securely.<br>We need a secure connection with proper authentication.<br>Ensure Query Execution is Reliable<br><br>Add error handling to prevent duplicate or incorrect entries.<br>Test &amp; Verify Data Submission<br><br>Run test cases to confirm PBIs are structured correctly in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ No External API Required → Runs fully within the GPT model’s environment.<br>✅ Faster Development → No need for external API setup.<br>✅ Tighter Integration with AI → AI can validate &amp; refine PBIs before submission.<br>✅ More Secure → Data never leaves the controlled environment.<br><br>2️⃣ Using OpenAI’s API for External Integration<br>If you prefer a fully programmatic approach, you can call OpenAI’s API from your backend and integrate it with your project management tool.<br><br>✅ How It Works<br>Your backend sends a request to OpenAI’s API, asking it to generate PBIs.<br>OpenAI’s API returns structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, Subtasks).<br>Your system validates the PBIs before inserting them into the database.<br>Your frontend retrieves and displays the PBIs in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of OpenAI’s API Approach<br>✅ More Customization → You control prompts, data structure, and validation.<br>✅ Can Run in the Background → Ideal for scheduled task automation.<br>✅ Scales Better → Works well for large teams &amp; real-time AI interactions.<br><br>🔷 Which Approach Should You Use?<br>🔹 If you want a fast, no-setup solution, go with Custom GPT Actions.<br>🔹 If you need more control, background processing, or external API calls, use OpenAI’s API.<br><br>🚀 Would you like help setting up a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs?<br><br>You said:<br>There is a price difference, right?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Yes, there is a price difference between using Custom GPT Actions and OpenAI’s API integration. Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers?

(Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints? (Launch dates, dependencies, etc.)<br>💡 Expected AI Output<br>Using these questions, AI should generate:<br><br>✅ Epics (High-level objectives)<br>✅ User Stories (Breaking down the work for users)<br>✅ Subtasks (Actionable development steps)<br>This structured input ensures AI can create high-quality, actionable PBIs instead of vague tasks.<br><br>🚀 Step 2: Wireframes - Full Page UI for AI Refinement<br>I’ll create Figma wireframes showcasing the full-page AI refinement process with:<br><br>Dropdown Combobox (Headless UI) to select an existing PBI.<br>AI-Powered Refinement Page (Clarifying Questions + PBI Generation).<br>Buttons to Open &amp; Edit PBIs in the System.<br>🔹 Let me generate the wireframes and share them with you shortly. 🚀<br><br>🚀 Step 3: Fixed Questions First, Dynamic Later<br>✅ We’ll start with fixed questions (predefined in the UI) to keep the process structured. ✅ If we later need more intelligent, adaptive AI prompts, we can introduce dynamic question generation.<br><br>🎯 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ I\'ll generate and share the Figma wireframes.<br>2️⃣ Once we have UI approval, we’ll define the API &amp; database structure.<br>3️⃣ Then, we move to implementation 🚀.<br><br>Let me work on the wireframes now! 🎨📌<br><br>You said:<br>A lot of the questions in step 1 could be answered by giving the AI access to technical doccumentation. <br>If the AI doesn´t find the answer there, then the question should be asked. <br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a fantastic approach! 🚀 By leveraging technical documentation, we can reduce user input fatigue and ensure AI-generated PBIs are as accurate as possible.<br><br>🔹 Refining the AI Questioning Process<br>Instead of blindly asking all 25+ questions, we will implement a smart, two-step process:<br><br>Step 1: Auto-Extract Answers from Technical Documentation<br>📌 Before asking the user anything, AI will try to find the answer from:<br><br>Project’s API Documentation (Endpoints, models, authentication, rate limits).<br>Database Schema (Relationships, constraints, existing data models).<br>Project’s Vision &amp; Goals (Product strategy, company objectives).<br>Past User Stories &amp; Epics (Ensuring consistency with previous PBIs).<br>Best Practices &amp; Key Learnings (Mistakes to avoid, past development issues).<br>Step 2: Ask Only the Unanswered Questions<br>📌 If AI can’t find an answer, it will only ask the missing information.<br><br>For example:<br><br>If API docs specify affected endpoints, AI skips “Which endpoints will be impacted?”<br>If the database schema reveals relationships, AI skips “What data models are involved?”<br>If a past User Story addressed similar issues, AI suggests improvements instead of asking from scratch.<br>🔹 UX Implementation: Full-Page AI Refinement Flow<br>✅ Step 1: User selects or creates a PBI.<br>✅ Step 2: AI scans project documentation for answers.<br>✅ Step 3: AI generates PBIs, showing:<br><br>🔹 Pre-filled answers from documentation.<br>🔹 Questions only for missing details.<br>✅ Step 4: User reviews &amp; refines before submitting.<br>This ensures: 🚀 Less manual input → AI handles most of the work.<br>🚀 More accurate PBIs → AI cross-checks against existing docs.<br>🚀 Faster process → Users answer only what AI can’t infer.<br><br>🔹 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes – I’ll create the UX flow for AI refinement.<br>2️⃣ Technical Documentation Strategy – We define:<br><br>📌 Where &amp; how AI should access project documentation.<br>📌 Which docs are needed for different PBI types.<br>3️⃣ Implementation Plan – Define how AI extracts, processes &amp; asks questions.<br>Would you like me to proceed with wireframes first or technical documentation strategy first? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>AI Estimation is the next thing we should include, so don´t bother asking the user for that.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Got it! 🚀 AI will automatically estimate Story Points instead of asking the user.<br><br>🔹 How AI Will Estimate Story Points<br>Instead of manually entering estimates, AI will calculate complexity, effort, and uncertainty based on:<br><br>1️⃣ Complexity Analysis<br><br>Database impact → Does it involve schema changes? Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great! I’ll now create Figma wireframes incorporating the AI Estimation Flow into the Task Refinement Page.<br><br>📌 Wireframe Features<br>🔹 Full-Page AI Refinement UI (instead of a modal)<br>🔹 Dropdown Combobox for Selecting a PBI (Headless UI)<br>🔹 Structured Form-Based AI Q&amp;A for refinement<br>🔹 Story Points Section:<br><br>Shows AI-estimated points with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override (switching to "User Edited")<br>I’ll generate the wireframes now! 🚀 Stay tuned. 🎨<br><br><br>Here is the wireframe for the AI-powered task refinement page! 🎨<br><br>Key Features in the Wireframe:<br>✅ Full-page layout for refining PBIs<br>✅ Dropdown combobox with search functionality to select a PBI<br>✅ AI-driven structured form where AI asks questions and users respond<br>✅ Story Points Estimation section:<br><br>Shows AI-generated values with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override, switching to a "User Edited" label<br>Would you like any modifications before we move forward with implementation? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Can you provide a text based UI description instead?<br>I just need the different components of the page that is needed and then I can do layout and design myself.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>AI-Powered Task Refinement Page - UI Structure<br>This page provides a structured interface for refining PBIs with AI assistance.

Below is the plan:<br><br>1️⃣ Where Should We Store Documentation?<br>Option 1: PostgreSQL (Best for Structured Documentation)<br>Store documentation as text in a dedicated table.<br>Allows version control and easy retrieval.<br>Can be indexed for faster AI retrieval.<br>Table: project_documentation<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE project_documentation (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,<br>title TEXT NOT NULL,<br>content TEXT NOT NULL,<br>source TEXT DEFAULT \'Manual Upload\',<br>uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>AI can efficiently search and extract relevant details.<br>Allows tagging &amp; filtering by source (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, Manual Upload).<br>Option 2: External File Storage (Best for Large Documents)<br>Store Markdown, TXT, or PDF files in an S3 bucket (AWS, Firebase, etc.).<br>Only metadata is stored in PostgreSQL.<br>AI retrieves and processes the files when needed.<br>Table: documentation_files<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE documentation_files (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,<br>file_url TEXT NOT NULL,<br>file_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (file_type IN (\'md\', \'txt\', \'pdf\')),<br>uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>Supports larger documents that may not fit in PostgreSQL.<br>Allows manual file uploads and auto-fetching from integrations.<br>2️⃣ Where in the UI Should the User Upload Documentation?<br>📂 Dedicated "Documentation Management" Page (Settings)<br>Location: Inside Settings &gt; Documentation.<br>Features:<br>Upload Markdown, TXT, PDF files.<br>View &amp; Edit existing documentation.<br>Connect integrations (GitHub, VS Code, Notion, etc.).<br>Configure AI access permissions for each document.<br>3️⃣ Automatic Documentation Retrieval<br>✅ Can We Integrate with GitHub, VS Code, or Notion?<br>Yes! We can fetch project documentation automatically from these sources:<br><br>Integration Method Use Case<br>GitHub Fetch .md files via API Pull documentation from repos<br>VS Code Read local .md files Sync local project docs<br>Notion API connection Import structured docs<br>Google Drive API connection Fetch shared project docs<br>📡 Example: GitHub API Integration<br>Fetch .md documentation from a GitHub repo:<br><br>python<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>import requests<br><br>GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_personal_token"<br>REPO_OWNER = "your_username"<br>REPO_NAME = "your_project"<br><br>url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{REPO_OWNER}/{REPO_NAME}/contents/docs"<br>headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"}<br><br>response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)<br>files = response.json()<br><br>for file in files:<br>if file["name"].endswith(".md"):<br>doc_content = requests.get(file["download_url"]).text<br>print("Fetched Documentation:", doc_content)<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>Automatically syncs up-to-date documentation from GitHub.<br>AI can use repo docs before asking the user for details.<br>4️⃣ Simple Settings Page for AI API &amp; Integrations<br>📌 Location: Settings &gt; AI &amp; Integrations<br><br>✅ User Can:<br><br>Enter OpenAI API Key.<br>Connect GitHub Repo (OAuth or Token).<br>Enable Auto-Fetch from VS Code, Notion, Google Drive.<br>Set AI Access Rules (e.g., Allow AI to modify docs?).<br>🔧 Database Table: integration_settings<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE integration_settings (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>integration_name TEXT NOT NULL,<br>api_key TEXT NOT NULL,<br>is_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>✅ Implement API endpoints for documentation storage &amp; retrieval.<br>✅ Build a simple settings page to manage AI API &amp; integrations.<br>✅ Set up GitHub/VS Code sync for fetching docs automatically.<br><br>Would you like mockups or wireframes for the settings page? 📐I´m still in planning mode, so let´s continue.<br><br><br>## AI driven creation of Epics, User stories and Subtasks.<br><br>I have, on several occasions when we have discussed a new feature and outlined a high level plan asked you to create epics, user stories and subtasks for the feature. <br><br>You are very good at this and it saves a lot of time compared to writing them manually. <br><br>However, we could create a process of this and include some steps were we go through some exercises that will help increase the quality of the output. <br>I´m thinking about:<br><br>1. Check PBI´s against the list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development<br><br>After every session we do a retrospective where we summarize the session. One section of the summary is a list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. Those should be appended to a complete list of key takeaways for future development.<br><br>Every time we create epics, user stories and subtasks for a new feature we should check them against this checklist of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2. Maybe use frameworks like user story mapping<br><br>3. Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1.

Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...)

Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints? (Launch dates, dependencies, etc.)<br>💡 Expected AI Output<br>Using these questions, AI should generate:<br><br>✅ Epics (High-level objectives)<br>✅ User Stories (Breaking down the work for users)<br>✅ Subtasks (Actionable development steps)<br>This structured input ensures AI can create high-quality, actionable PBIs instead of vague tasks.<br><br>🚀 Step 2: Wireframes - Full Page UI for AI Refinement<br>I’ll create Figma wireframes showcasing the full-page AI refinement process with:<br><br>Dropdown Combobox (Headless UI) to select an existing PBI.<br>AI-Powered Refinement Page (Clarifying Questions + PBI Generation).<br>Buttons to Open &amp; Edit PBIs in the System.<br>🔹 Let me generate the wireframes and share them with you shortly. 🚀<br><br>🚀 Step 3: Fixed Questions First, Dynamic Later<br>✅ We’ll start with fixed questions (predefined in the UI) to keep the process structured. ✅ If we later need more intelligent, adaptive AI prompts, we can introduce dynamic question generation.<br><br>🎯 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ I\'ll generate and share the Figma wireframes.<br>2️⃣ Once we have UI approval, we’ll define the API &amp; database structure.<br>3️⃣ Then, we move to implementation 🚀.<br><br>Let me work on the wireframes now! 🎨📌<br><br>You said:<br>A lot of the questions in step 1 could be answered by giving the AI access to technical doccumentation. <br>If the AI doesn´t find the answer there, then the question should be asked. <br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a fantastic approach! 🚀 By leveraging technical documentation, we can reduce user input fatigue and ensure AI-generated PBIs are as accurate as possible.<br><br>🔹 Refining the AI Questioning Process<br>Instead of blindly asking all 25+ questions, we will implement a smart, two-step process:<br><br>Step 1: Auto-Extract Answers from Technical Documentation<br>📌 Before asking the user anything, AI will try to find the answer from:<br><br>Project’s API Documentation (Endpoints, models, authentication, rate limits).<br>Database Schema (Relationships, constraints, existing data models).<br>Project’s Vision &amp; Goals (Product strategy, company objectives).<br>Past User Stories &amp; Epics (Ensuring consistency with previous PBIs).<br>Best Practices &amp; Key Learnings (Mistakes to avoid, past development issues).<br>Step 2: Ask Only the Unanswered Questions<br>📌 If AI can’t find an answer, it will only ask the missing information.<br><br>For example:<br><br>If API docs specify affected endpoints, AI skips “Which endpoints will be impacted?”<br>If the database schema reveals relationships, AI skips “What data models are involved?”<br>If a past User Story addressed similar issues, AI suggests improvements instead of asking from scratch.<br>🔹 UX Implementation: Full-Page AI Refinement Flow<br>✅ Step 1: User selects or creates a PBI.<br>✅ Step 2: AI scans project documentation for answers.<br>✅ Step 3: AI generates PBIs, showing:<br><br>🔹 Pre-filled answers from documentation.<br>🔹 Questions only for missing details.<br>✅ Step 4: User reviews &amp; refines before submitting.<br>This ensures: 🚀 Less manual input → AI handles most of the work.<br>🚀 More accurate PBIs → AI cross-checks against existing docs.<br>🚀 Faster process → Users answer only what AI can’t infer.<br><br>🔹 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes – I’ll create the UX flow for AI refinement.<br>2️⃣ Technical Documentation Strategy – We define:<br><br>📌 Where &amp; how AI should access project documentation.<br>📌 Which docs are needed for different PBI types.<br>3️⃣ Implementation Plan – Define how AI extracts, processes &amp; asks questions.<br>Would you like me to proceed with wireframes first or technical documentation strategy first? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>AI Estimation is the next thing we should include, so don´t bother asking the user for that.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Got it! 🚀 AI will automatically estimate Story Points instead of asking the user.<br><br>🔹 How AI Will Estimate Story Points<br>Instead of manually entering estimates, AI will calculate complexity, effort, and uncertainty based on:<br><br>1️⃣ Complexity Analysis<br><br>Database impact → Does it involve schema changes? Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great!

Check PBI´s against the list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development<br><br>After every session we do a retrospective where we summarize the session. One section of the summary is a list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. Those should be appended to a complete list of key takeaways for future development.<br><br>Every time we create epics, user stories and subtasks for a new feature we should check them against this checklist of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2. Maybe use frameworks like user story mapping<br><br>3. Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1. Create Epics, User stories and subtasks from a refined feature request.<br>2. Script them into the database of autoagile<br>3. Allow AI to read the tasks<br><br><br>This is a great initiative that will systematize and automate the process of turning feature ideas into well-structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks). Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...) "<br>Grant Secure Database Access<br><br>Custom GPT must be allowed to execute database operations securely.<br>We need a secure connection with proper authentication.<br>Ensure Query Execution is Reliable<br><br>Add error handling to prevent duplicate or incorrect entries.<br>Test &amp; Verify Data Submission<br><br>Run test cases to confirm PBIs are structured correctly in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ No External API Required → Runs fully within the GPT model’s environment.<br>✅ Faster Development → No need for external API setup.<br>✅ Tighter Integration with AI → AI can validate &amp; refine PBIs before submission.<br>✅ More Secure → Data never leaves the controlled environment.<br><br>2️⃣ Using OpenAI’s API for External Integration<br>If you prefer a fully programmatic approach, you can call OpenAI’s API from your backend and integrate it with your project management tool.<br><br>✅ How It Works<br>Your backend sends a request to OpenAI’s API, asking it to generate PBIs.<br>OpenAI’s API returns structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, Subtasks).<br>Your system validates the PBIs before inserting them into the database.<br>Your frontend retrieves and displays the PBIs in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of OpenAI’s API Approach<br>✅ More Customization → You control prompts, data structure, and validation.<br>✅ Can Run in the Background → Ideal for scheduled task automation.<br>✅ Scales Better → Works well for large teams &amp; real-time AI interactions.<br><br>🔷 Which Approach Should You Use?<br>🔹 If you want a fast, no-setup solution, go with Custom GPT Actions.<br>🔹 If you need more control, background processing, or external API calls, use OpenAI’s API.<br><br>🚀 Would you like help setting up a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs?<br><br>You said:<br>There is a price difference, right?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Yes, there is a price difference between using Custom GPT Actions and OpenAI’s API integration. Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers?

(Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints? (Launch dates, dependencies, etc.)<br>💡 Expected AI Output<br>Using these questions, AI should generate:<br><br>✅ Epics (High-level objectives)<br>✅ User Stories (Breaking down the work for users)<br>✅ Subtasks (Actionable development steps)<br>This structured input ensures AI can create high-quality, actionable PBIs instead of vague tasks.<br><br>🚀 Step 2: Wireframes - Full Page UI for AI Refinement<br>I’ll create Figma wireframes showcasing the full-page AI refinement process with:<br><br>Dropdown Combobox (Headless UI) to select an existing PBI.<br>AI-Powered Refinement Page (Clarifying Questions + PBI Generation).<br>Buttons to Open &amp; Edit PBIs in the System.<br>🔹 Let me generate the wireframes and share them with you shortly. 🚀<br><br>🚀 Step 3: Fixed Questions First, Dynamic Later<br>✅ We’ll start with fixed questions (predefined in the UI) to keep the process structured. ✅ If we later need more intelligent, adaptive AI prompts, we can introduce dynamic question generation.<br><br>🎯 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ I\'ll generate and share the Figma wireframes.<br>2️⃣ Once we have UI approval, we’ll define the API &amp; database structure.<br>3️⃣ Then, we move to implementation 🚀.<br><br>Let me work on the wireframes now! 🎨📌<br><br>You said:<br>A lot of the questions in step 1 could be answered by giving the AI access to technical doccumentation. <br>If the AI doesn´t find the answer there, then the question should be asked. <br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a fantastic approach! 🚀 By leveraging technical documentation, we can reduce user input fatigue and ensure AI-generated PBIs are as accurate as possible.<br><br>🔹 Refining the AI Questioning Process<br>Instead of blindly asking all 25+ questions, we will implement a smart, two-step process:<br><br>Step 1: Auto-Extract Answers from Technical Documentation<br>📌 Before asking the user anything, AI will try to find the answer from:<br><br>Project’s API Documentation (Endpoints, models, authentication, rate limits).<br>Database Schema (Relationships, constraints, existing data models).<br>Project’s Vision &amp; Goals (Product strategy, company objectives).<br>Past User Stories &amp; Epics (Ensuring consistency with previous PBIs).<br>Best Practices &amp; Key Learnings (Mistakes to avoid, past development issues).<br>Step 2: Ask Only the Unanswered Questions<br>📌 If AI can’t find an answer, it will only ask the missing information.<br><br>For example:<br><br>If API docs specify affected endpoints, AI skips “Which endpoints will be impacted?”<br>If the database schema reveals relationships, AI skips “What data models are involved?”<br>If a past User Story addressed similar issues, AI suggests improvements instead of asking from scratch.<br>🔹 UX Implementation: Full-Page AI Refinement Flow<br>✅ Step 1: User selects or creates a PBI.<br>✅ Step 2: AI scans project documentation for answers.<br>✅ Step 3: AI generates PBIs, showing:<br><br>🔹 Pre-filled answers from documentation.<br>🔹 Questions only for missing details.<br>✅ Step 4: User reviews &amp; refines before submitting.<br>This ensures: 🚀 Less manual input → AI handles most of the work.<br>🚀 More accurate PBIs → AI cross-checks against existing docs.<br>🚀 Faster process → Users answer only what AI can’t infer.<br><br>🔹 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes – I’ll create the UX flow for AI refinement.<br>2️⃣ Technical Documentation Strategy – We define:<br><br>📌 Where &amp; how AI should access project documentation.<br>📌 Which docs are needed for different PBI types.<br>3️⃣ Implementation Plan – Define how AI extracts, processes &amp; asks questions.<br>Would you like me to proceed with wireframes first or technical documentation strategy first? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>AI Estimation is the next thing we should include, so don´t bother asking the user for that.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Got it! 🚀 AI will automatically estimate Story Points instead of asking the user.<br><br>🔹 How AI Will Estimate Story Points<br>Instead of manually entering estimates, AI will calculate complexity, effort, and uncertainty based on:<br><br>1️⃣ Complexity Analysis<br><br>Database impact → Does it involve schema changes? Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great! I’ll now create Figma wireframes incorporating the AI Estimation Flow into the Task Refinement Page.<br><br>📌 Wireframe Features<br>🔹 Full-Page AI Refinement UI (instead of a modal)<br>🔹 Dropdown Combobox for Selecting a PBI (Headless UI)<br>🔹 Structured Form-Based AI Q&amp;A for refinement<br>🔹 Story Points Section:<br><br>Shows AI-estimated points with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override (switching to "User Edited")<br>I’ll generate the wireframes now! 🚀 Stay tuned. 🎨<br><br><br>Here is the wireframe for the AI-powered task refinement page! 🎨<br><br>Key Features in the Wireframe:<br>✅ Full-page layout for refining PBIs<br>✅ Dropdown combobox with search functionality to select a PBI<br>✅ AI-driven structured form where AI asks questions and users respond<br>✅ Story Points Estimation section:<br><br>Shows AI-generated values with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override, switching to a "User Edited" label<br>Would you like any modifications before we move forward with implementation? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Can you provide a text based UI description instead?<br>I just need the different components of the page that is needed and then I can do layout and design myself.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>AI-Powered Task Refinement Page - UI Structure<br>This page provides a structured interface for refining PBIs with AI assistance.

Below is the plan:<br><br>1️⃣ Where Should We Store Documentation?<br>Option 1: PostgreSQL (Best for Structured Documentation)<br>Store documentation as text in a dedicated table.<br>Allows version control and easy retrieval.<br>Can be indexed for faster AI retrieval.<br>Table: project_documentation<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE project_documentation (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,<br>title TEXT NOT NULL,<br>content TEXT NOT NULL,<br>source TEXT DEFAULT \'Manual Upload\',<br>uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>AI can efficiently search and extract relevant details.<br>Allows tagging &amp; filtering by source (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, Manual Upload).<br>Option 2: External File Storage (Best for Large Documents)<br>Store Markdown, TXT, or PDF files in an S3 bucket (AWS, Firebase, etc.).<br>Only metadata is stored in PostgreSQL.<br>AI retrieves and processes the files when needed.<br>Table: documentation_files<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE documentation_files (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,<br>file_url TEXT NOT NULL,<br>file_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (file_type IN (\'md\', \'txt\', \'pdf\')),<br>uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>Supports larger documents that may not fit in PostgreSQL.<br>Allows manual file uploads and auto-fetching from integrations.<br>2️⃣ Where in the UI Should the User Upload Documentation?<br>📂 Dedicated "Documentation Management" Page (Settings)<br>Location: Inside Settings &gt; Documentation.<br>Features:<br>Upload Markdown, TXT, PDF files.<br>View &amp; Edit existing documentation.<br>Connect integrations (GitHub, VS Code, Notion, etc.).<br>Configure AI access permissions for each document.<br>3️⃣ Automatic Documentation Retrieval<br>✅ Can We Integrate with GitHub, VS Code, or Notion?<br>Yes! We can fetch project documentation automatically from these sources:<br><br>Integration Method Use Case<br>GitHub Fetch .md files via API Pull documentation from repos<br>VS Code Read local .md files Sync local project docs<br>Notion API connection Import structured docs<br>Google Drive API connection Fetch shared project docs<br>📡 Example: GitHub API Integration<br>Fetch .md documentation from a GitHub repo:<br><br>python<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>import requests<br><br>GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_personal_token"<br>REPO_OWNER = "your_username"<br>REPO_NAME = "your_project"<br><br>url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{REPO_OWNER}/{REPO_NAME}/contents/docs"<br>headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"}<br><br>response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)<br>files = response.json()<br><br>for file in files:<br>if file["name"].endswith(".md"):<br>doc_content = requests.get(file["download_url"]).text<br>print("Fetched Documentation:", doc_content)<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>Automatically syncs up-to-date documentation from GitHub.<br>AI can use repo docs before asking the user for details.<br>4️⃣ Simple Settings Page for AI API &amp; Integrations<br>📌 Location: Settings &gt; AI &amp; Integrations<br><br>✅ User Can:<br><br>Enter OpenAI API Key.<br>Connect GitHub Repo (OAuth or Token).<br>Enable Auto-Fetch from VS Code, Notion, Google Drive.<br>Set AI Access Rules (e.g., Allow AI to modify docs?).<br>🔧 Database Table: integration_settings<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE integration_settings (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>integration_name TEXT NOT NULL,<br>api_key TEXT NOT NULL,<br>is_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>✅ Implement API endpoints for documentation storage &amp; retrieval.<br>✅ Build a simple settings page to manage AI API &amp; integrations.<br>✅ Set up GitHub/VS Code sync for fetching docs automatically.<br><br>Would you like mockups or wireframes for the settings page? 📐I´m still in planning mode, so let´s continue.<br><br><br>## AI driven creation of Epics, User stories and Subtasks.<br><br>I have, on several occasions when we have discussed a new feature and outlined a high level plan asked you to create epics, user stories and subtasks for the feature. <br><br>You are very good at this and it saves a lot of time compared to writing them manually. <br><br>However, we could create a process of this and include some steps were we go through some exercises that will help increase the quality of the output. <br>I´m thinking about:<br><br>1. Check PBI´s against the list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development<br><br>After every session we do a retrospective where we summarize the session. One section of the summary is a list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. Those should be appended to a complete list of key takeaways for future development.<br><br>Every time we create epics, user stories and subtasks for a new feature we should check them against this checklist of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2. Maybe use frameworks like user story mapping<br><br>3. Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1.

Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...)

Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints? (Launch dates, dependencies, etc.)<br>💡 Expected AI Output<br>Using these questions, AI should generate:<br><br>✅ Epics (High-level objectives)<br>✅ User Stories (Breaking down the work for users)<br>✅ Subtasks (Actionable development steps)<br>This structured input ensures AI can create high-quality, actionable PBIs instead of vague tasks.<br><br>🚀 Step 2: Wireframes - Full Page UI for AI Refinement<br>I’ll create Figma wireframes showcasing the full-page AI refinement process with:<br><br>Dropdown Combobox (Headless UI) to select an existing PBI.<br>AI-Powered Refinement Page (Clarifying Questions + PBI Generation).<br>Buttons to Open &amp; Edit PBIs in the System.<br>🔹 Let me generate the wireframes and share them with you shortly. 🚀<br><br>🚀 Step 3: Fixed Questions First, Dynamic Later<br>✅ We’ll start with fixed questions (predefined in the UI) to keep the process structured. ✅ If we later need more intelligent, adaptive AI prompts, we can introduce dynamic question generation.<br><br>🎯 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ I\'ll generate and share the Figma wireframes.<br>2️⃣ Once we have UI approval, we’ll define the API &amp; database structure.<br>3️⃣ Then, we move to implementation 🚀.<br><br>Let me work on the wireframes now! 🎨📌<br><br>You said:<br>A lot of the questions in step 1 could be answered by giving the AI access to technical doccumentation. <br>If the AI doesn´t find the answer there, then the question should be asked. <br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a fantastic approach! 🚀 By leveraging technical documentation, we can reduce user input fatigue and ensure AI-generated PBIs are as accurate as possible.<br><br>🔹 Refining the AI Questioning Process<br>Instead of blindly asking all 25+ questions, we will implement a smart, two-step process:<br><br>Step 1: Auto-Extract Answers from Technical Documentation<br>📌 Before asking the user anything, AI will try to find the answer from:<br><br>Project’s API Documentation (Endpoints, models, authentication, rate limits).<br>Database Schema (Relationships, constraints, existing data models).<br>Project’s Vision &amp; Goals (Product strategy, company objectives).<br>Past User Stories &amp; Epics (Ensuring consistency with previous PBIs).<br>Best Practices &amp; Key Learnings (Mistakes to avoid, past development issues).<br>Step 2: Ask Only the Unanswered Questions<br>📌 If AI can’t find an answer, it will only ask the missing information.<br><br>For example:<br><br>If API docs specify affected endpoints, AI skips “Which endpoints will be impacted?”<br>If the database schema reveals relationships, AI skips “What data models are involved?”<br>If a past User Story addressed similar issues, AI suggests improvements instead of asking from scratch.<br>🔹 UX Implementation: Full-Page AI Refinement Flow<br>✅ Step 1: User selects or creates a PBI.<br>✅ Step 2: AI scans project documentation for answers.<br>✅ Step 3: AI generates PBIs, showing:<br><br>🔹 Pre-filled answers from documentation.<br>🔹 Questions only for missing details.<br>✅ Step 4: User reviews &amp; refines before submitting.<br>This ensures: 🚀 Less manual input → AI handles most of the work.<br>🚀 More accurate PBIs → AI cross-checks against existing docs.<br>🚀 Faster process → Users answer only what AI can’t infer.<br><br>🔹 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes – I’ll create the UX flow for AI refinement.<br>2️⃣ Technical Documentation Strategy – We define:<br><br>📌 Where &amp; how AI should access project documentation.<br>📌 Which docs are needed for different PBI types.<br>3️⃣ Implementation Plan – Define how AI extracts, processes &amp; asks questions.<br>Would you like me to proceed with wireframes first or technical documentation strategy first? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>AI Estimation is the next thing we should include, so don´t bother asking the user for that.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Got it! 🚀 AI will automatically estimate Story Points instead of asking the user.<br><br>🔹 How AI Will Estimate Story Points<br>Instead of manually entering estimates, AI will calculate complexity, effort, and uncertainty based on:<br><br>1️⃣ Complexity Analysis<br><br>Database impact → Does it involve schema changes? Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great!

Check PBI´s against the list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development<br><br>After every session we do a retrospective where we summarize the session. One section of the summary is a list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. Those should be appended to a complete list of key takeaways for future development.<br><br>Every time we create epics, user stories and subtasks for a new feature we should check them against this checklist of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2. Maybe use frameworks like user story mapping<br><br>3. Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1.

Allow AI to read the tasks<br><br><br>This is a great initiative that will systematize and automate the process of turning feature ideas into well-structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks). Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...)

Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints? (Launch dates, dependencies, etc.)<br>💡 Expected AI Output<br>Using these questions, AI should generate:<br><br>✅ Epics (High-level objectives)<br>✅ User Stories (Breaking down the work for users)<br>✅ Subtasks (Actionable development steps)<br>This structured input ensures AI can create high-quality, actionable PBIs instead of vague tasks.<br><br>🚀 Step 2: Wireframes - Full Page UI for AI Refinement<br>I’ll create Figma wireframes showcasing the full-page AI refinement process with:<br><br>Dropdown Combobox (Headless UI) to select an existing PBI.<br>AI-Powered Refinement Page (Clarifying Questions + PBI Generation).<br>Buttons to Open &amp; Edit PBIs in the System.<br>🔹 Let me generate the wireframes and share them with you shortly. 🚀<br><br>🚀 Step 3: Fixed Questions First, Dynamic Later<br>✅ We’ll start with fixed questions (predefined in the UI) to keep the process structured. ✅ If we later need more intelligent, adaptive AI prompts, we can introduce dynamic question generation.<br><br>🎯 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ I\'ll generate and share the Figma wireframes.<br>2️⃣ Once we have UI approval, we’ll define the API &amp; database structure.<br>3️⃣ Then, we move to implementation 🚀.<br><br>Let me work on the wireframes now! 🎨📌<br><br>You said:<br>A lot of the questions in step 1 could be answered by giving the AI access to technical doccumentation. <br>If the AI doesn´t find the answer there, then the question should be asked. <br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a fantastic approach! 🚀 By leveraging technical documentation, we can reduce user input fatigue and ensure AI-generated PBIs are as accurate as possible.<br><br>🔹 Refining the AI Questioning Process<br>Instead of blindly asking all 25+ questions, we will implement a smart, two-step process:<br><br>Step 1: Auto-Extract Answers from Technical Documentation<br>📌 Before asking the user anything, AI will try to find the answer from:<br><br>Project’s API Documentation (Endpoints, models, authentication, rate limits).<br>Database Schema (Relationships, constraints, existing data models).<br>Project’s Vision &amp; Goals (Product strategy, company objectives).<br>Past User Stories &amp; Epics (Ensuring consistency with previous PBIs).<br>Best Practices &amp; Key Learnings (Mistakes to avoid, past development issues).<br>Step 2: Ask Only the Unanswered Questions<br>📌 If AI can’t find an answer, it will only ask the missing information.<br><br>For example:<br><br>If API docs specify affected endpoints, AI skips “Which endpoints will be impacted?”<br>If the database schema reveals relationships, AI skips “What data models are involved?”<br>If a past User Story addressed similar issues, AI suggests improvements instead of asking from scratch.<br>🔹 UX Implementation: Full-Page AI Refinement Flow<br>✅ Step 1: User selects or creates a PBI.<br>✅ Step 2: AI scans project documentation for answers.<br>✅ Step 3: AI generates PBIs, showing:<br><br>🔹 Pre-filled answers from documentation.<br>🔹 Questions only for missing details.<br>✅ Step 4: User reviews &amp; refines before submitting.<br>This ensures: 🚀 Less manual input → AI handles most of the work.<br>🚀 More accurate PBIs → AI cross-checks against existing docs.<br>🚀 Faster process → Users answer only what AI can’t infer.<br><br>🔹 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes – I’ll create the UX flow for AI refinement.<br>2️⃣ Technical Documentation Strategy – We define:<br><br>📌 Where &amp; how AI should access project documentation.<br>📌 Which docs are needed for different PBI types.<br>3️⃣ Implementation Plan – Define how AI extracts, processes &amp; asks questions.<br>Would you like me to proceed with wireframes first or technical documentation strategy first? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>AI Estimation is the next thing we should include, so don´t bother asking the user for that.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Got it! 🚀 AI will automatically estimate Story Points instead of asking the user.<br><br>🔹 How AI Will Estimate Story Points<br>Instead of manually entering estimates, AI will calculate complexity, effort, and uncertainty based on:<br><br>1️⃣ Complexity Analysis<br><br>Database impact → Does it involve schema changes? Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great!

One section of the summary is a list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. Those should be appended to a complete list of key takeaways for future development.<br><br>Every time we create epics, user stories and subtasks for a new feature we should check them against this checklist of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2.

Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1. Create Epics, User stories and subtasks from a refined feature request.<br>2. Script them into the database of autoagile<br>3. Allow AI to read the tasks<br><br><br>This is a great initiative that will systematize and automate the process of turning feature ideas into well-structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks). Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...) "<br>Grant Secure Database Access<br><br>Custom GPT must be allowed to execute database operations securely.<br>We need a secure connection with proper authentication.<br>Ensure Query Execution is Reliable<br><br>Add error handling to prevent duplicate or incorrect entries.<br>Test &amp; Verify Data Submission<br><br>Run test cases to confirm PBIs are structured correctly in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ No External API Required → Runs fully within the GPT model’s environment.<br>✅ Faster Development → No need for external API setup.<br>✅ Tighter Integration with AI → AI can validate &amp; refine PBIs before submission.<br>✅ More Secure → Data never leaves the controlled environment.<br><br>2️⃣ Using OpenAI’s API for External Integration<br>If you prefer a fully programmatic approach, you can call OpenAI’s API from your backend and integrate it with your project management tool.<br><br>✅ How It Works<br>Your backend sends a request to OpenAI’s API, asking it to generate PBIs.<br>OpenAI’s API returns structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, Subtasks).<br>Your system validates the PBIs before inserting them into the database.<br>Your frontend retrieves and displays the PBIs in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of OpenAI’s API Approach<br>✅ More Customization → You control prompts, data structure, and validation.<br>✅ Can Run in the Background → Ideal for scheduled task automation.<br>✅ Scales Better → Works well for large teams &amp; real-time AI interactions.<br><br>🔷 Which Approach Should You Use?<br>🔹 If you want a fast, no-setup solution, go with Custom GPT Actions.<br>🔹 If you need more control, background processing, or external API calls, use OpenAI’s API.<br><br>🚀 Would you like help setting up a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs?<br><br>You said:<br>There is a price difference, right?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Yes, there is a price difference between using Custom GPT Actions and OpenAI’s API integration. Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints?

Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great! I’ll now create Figma wireframes incorporating the AI Estimation Flow into the Task Refinement Page.<br><br>📌 Wireframe Features<br>🔹 Full-Page AI Refinement UI (instead of a modal)<br>🔹 Dropdown Combobox for Selecting a PBI (Headless UI)<br>🔹 Structured Form-Based AI Q&amp;A for refinement<br>🔹 Story Points Section:<br><br>Shows AI-estimated points with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override (switching to "User Edited")<br>I’ll generate the wireframes now! 🚀 Stay tuned. 🎨<br><br><br>Here is the wireframe for the AI-powered task refinement page! 🎨<br><br>Key Features in the Wireframe:<br>✅ Full-page layout for refining PBIs<br>✅ Dropdown combobox with search functionality to select a PBI<br>✅ AI-driven structured form where AI asks questions and users respond<br>✅ Story Points Estimation section:<br><br>Shows AI-generated values with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override, switching to a "User Edited" label<br>Would you like any modifications before we move forward with implementation? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Can you provide a text based UI description instead?<br>I just need the different components of the page that is needed and then I can do layout and design myself.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>AI-Powered Task Refinement Page - UI Structure<br>This page provides a structured interface for refining PBIs with AI assistance.

Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...)

Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints? (Launch dates, dependencies, etc.)<br>💡 Expected AI Output<br>Using these questions, AI should generate:<br><br>✅ Epics (High-level objectives)<br>✅ User Stories (Breaking down the work for users)<br>✅ Subtasks (Actionable development steps)<br>This structured input ensures AI can create high-quality, actionable PBIs instead of vague tasks.<br><br>🚀 Step 2: Wireframes - Full Page UI for AI Refinement<br>I’ll create Figma wireframes showcasing the full-page AI refinement process with:<br><br>Dropdown Combobox (Headless UI) to select an existing PBI.<br>AI-Powered Refinement Page (Clarifying Questions + PBI Generation).<br>Buttons to Open &amp; Edit PBIs in the System.<br>🔹 Let me generate the wireframes and share them with you shortly. 🚀<br><br>🚀 Step 3: Fixed Questions First, Dynamic Later<br>✅ We’ll start with fixed questions (predefined in the UI) to keep the process structured. ✅ If we later need more intelligent, adaptive AI prompts, we can introduce dynamic question generation.<br><br>🎯 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ I\'ll generate and share the Figma wireframes.<br>2️⃣ Once we have UI approval, we’ll define the API &amp; database structure.<br>3️⃣ Then, we move to implementation 🚀.<br><br>Let me work on the wireframes now! 🎨📌<br><br>You said:<br>A lot of the questions in step 1 could be answered by giving the AI access to technical doccumentation. <br>If the AI doesn´t find the answer there, then the question should be asked. <br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a fantastic approach! 🚀 By leveraging technical documentation, we can reduce user input fatigue and ensure AI-generated PBIs are as accurate as possible.<br><br>🔹 Refining the AI Questioning Process<br>Instead of blindly asking all 25+ questions, we will implement a smart, two-step process:<br><br>Step 1: Auto-Extract Answers from Technical Documentation<br>📌 Before asking the user anything, AI will try to find the answer from:<br><br>Project’s API Documentation (Endpoints, models, authentication, rate limits).<br>Database Schema (Relationships, constraints, existing data models).<br>Project’s Vision &amp; Goals (Product strategy, company objectives).<br>Past User Stories &amp; Epics (Ensuring consistency with previous PBIs).<br>Best Practices &amp; Key Learnings (Mistakes to avoid, past development issues).<br>Step 2: Ask Only the Unanswered Questions<br>📌 If AI can’t find an answer, it will only ask the missing information.<br><br>For example:<br><br>If API docs specify affected endpoints, AI skips “Which endpoints will be impacted?”<br>If the database schema reveals relationships, AI skips “What data models are involved?”<br>If a past User Story addressed similar issues, AI suggests improvements instead of asking from scratch.<br>🔹 UX Implementation: Full-Page AI Refinement Flow<br>✅ Step 1: User selects or creates a PBI.<br>✅ Step 2: AI scans project documentation for answers.<br>✅ Step 3: AI generates PBIs, showing:<br><br>🔹 Pre-filled answers from documentation.<br>🔹 Questions only for missing details.<br>✅ Step 4: User reviews &amp; refines before submitting.<br>This ensures: 🚀 Less manual input → AI handles most of the work.<br>🚀 More accurate PBIs → AI cross-checks against existing docs.<br>🚀 Faster process → Users answer only what AI can’t infer.<br><br>🔹 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes – I’ll create the UX flow for AI refinement.<br>2️⃣ Technical Documentation Strategy – We define:<br><br>📌 Where &amp; how AI should access project documentation.<br>📌 Which docs are needed for different PBI types.<br>3️⃣ Implementation Plan – Define how AI extracts, processes &amp; asks questions.<br>Would you like me to proceed with wireframes first or technical documentation strategy first? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>AI Estimation is the next thing we should include, so don´t bother asking the user for that.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Got it! 🚀 AI will automatically estimate Story Points instead of asking the user.<br><br>🔹 How AI Will Estimate Story Points<br>Instead of manually entering estimates, AI will calculate complexity, effort, and uncertainty based on:<br><br>1️⃣ Complexity Analysis<br><br>Database impact → Does it involve schema changes? Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great!

One section of the summary is a list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. Those should be appended to a complete list of key takeaways for future development.<br><br>Every time we create epics, user stories and subtasks for a new feature we should check them against this checklist of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2.

Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1. Create Epics, User stories and subtasks from a refined feature request.<br>2. Script them into the database of autoagile<br>3. Allow AI to read the tasks<br><br><br>This is a great initiative that will systematize and automate the process of turning feature ideas into well-structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks). Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...) "<br>Grant Secure Database Access<br><br>Custom GPT must be allowed to execute database operations securely.<br>We need a secure connection with proper authentication.<br>Ensure Query Execution is Reliable<br><br>Add error handling to prevent duplicate or incorrect entries.<br>Test &amp; Verify Data Submission<br><br>Run test cases to confirm PBIs are structured correctly in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ No External API Required → Runs fully within the GPT model’s environment.<br>✅ Faster Development → No need for external API setup.<br>✅ Tighter Integration with AI → AI can validate &amp; refine PBIs before submission.<br>✅ More Secure → Data never leaves the controlled environment.<br><br>2️⃣ Using OpenAI’s API for External Integration<br>If you prefer a fully programmatic approach, you can call OpenAI’s API from your backend and integrate it with your project management tool.<br><br>✅ How It Works<br>Your backend sends a request to OpenAI’s API, asking it to generate PBIs.<br>OpenAI’s API returns structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, Subtasks).<br>Your system validates the PBIs before inserting them into the database.<br>Your frontend retrieves and displays the PBIs in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of OpenAI’s API Approach<br>✅ More Customization → You control prompts, data structure, and validation.<br>✅ Can Run in the Background → Ideal for scheduled task automation.<br>✅ Scales Better → Works well for large teams &amp; real-time AI interactions.<br><br>🔷 Which Approach Should You Use?<br>🔹 If you want a fast, no-setup solution, go with Custom GPT Actions.<br>🔹 If you need more control, background processing, or external API calls, use OpenAI’s API.<br><br>🚀 Would you like help setting up a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs?<br><br>You said:<br>There is a price difference, right?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Yes, there is a price difference between using Custom GPT Actions and OpenAI’s API integration. Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints?

Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great! I’ll now create Figma wireframes incorporating the AI Estimation Flow into the Task Refinement Page.<br><br>📌 Wireframe Features<br>🔹 Full-Page AI Refinement UI (instead of a modal)<br>🔹 Dropdown Combobox for Selecting a PBI (Headless UI)<br>🔹 Structured Form-Based AI Q&amp;A for refinement<br>🔹 Story Points Section:<br><br>Shows AI-estimated points with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override (switching to "User Edited")<br>I’ll generate the wireframes now! 🚀 Stay tuned. 🎨<br><br><br>Here is the wireframe for the AI-powered task refinement page! 🎨<br><br>Key Features in the Wireframe:<br>✅ Full-page layout for refining PBIs<br>✅ Dropdown combobox with search functionality to select a PBI<br>✅ AI-driven structured form where AI asks questions and users respond<br>✅ Story Points Estimation section:<br><br>Shows AI-generated values with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override, switching to a "User Edited" label<br>Would you like any modifications before we move forward with implementation? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Can you provide a text based UI description instead?<br>I just need the different components of the page that is needed and then I can do layout and design myself.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>AI-Powered Task Refinement Page - UI Structure<br>This page provides a structured interface for refining PBIs with AI assistance.

Below is the plan:<br><br>1️⃣ Where Should We Store Documentation?<br>Option 1: PostgreSQL (Best for Structured Documentation)<br>Store documentation as text in a dedicated table.<br>Allows version control and easy retrieval.<br>Can be indexed for faster AI retrieval.<br>Table: project_documentation<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE project_documentation (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,<br>title TEXT NOT NULL,<br>content TEXT NOT NULL,<br>source TEXT DEFAULT \'Manual Upload\',<br>uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>AI can efficiently search and extract relevant details.<br>Allows tagging &amp; filtering by source (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, Manual Upload).<br>Option 2: External File Storage (Best for Large Documents)<br>Store Markdown, TXT, or PDF files in an S3 bucket (AWS, Firebase, etc.).<br>Only metadata is stored in PostgreSQL.<br>AI retrieves and processes the files when needed.<br>Table: documentation_files<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE documentation_files (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,<br>file_url TEXT NOT NULL,<br>file_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (file_type IN (\'md\', \'txt\', \'pdf\')),<br>uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>Supports larger documents that may not fit in PostgreSQL.<br>Allows manual file uploads and auto-fetching from integrations.<br>2️⃣ Where in the UI Should the User Upload Documentation?<br>📂 Dedicated "Documentation Management" Page (Settings)<br>Location: Inside Settings &gt; Documentation.<br>Features:<br>Upload Markdown, TXT, PDF files.<br>View &amp; Edit existing documentation.<br>Connect integrations (GitHub, VS Code, Notion, etc.).<br>Configure AI access permissions for each document.<br>3️⃣ Automatic Documentation Retrieval<br>✅ Can We Integrate with GitHub, VS Code, or Notion?<br>Yes! We can fetch project documentation automatically from these sources:<br><br>Integration Method Use Case<br>GitHub Fetch .md files via API Pull documentation from repos<br>VS Code Read local .md files Sync local project docs<br>Notion API connection Import structured docs<br>Google Drive API connection Fetch shared project docs<br>📡 Example: GitHub API Integration<br>Fetch .md documentation from a GitHub repo:<br><br>python<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>import requests<br><br>GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_personal_token"<br>REPO_OWNER = "your_username"<br>REPO_NAME = "your_project"<br><br>url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{REPO_OWNER}/{REPO_NAME}/contents/docs"<br>headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"}<br><br>response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)<br>files = response.json()<br><br>for file in files:<br>if file["name"].endswith(".md"):<br>doc_content = requests.get(file["download_url"]).text<br>print("Fetched Documentation:", doc_content)<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>Automatically syncs up-to-date documentation from GitHub.<br>AI can use repo docs before asking the user for details.<br>4️⃣ Simple Settings Page for AI API &amp; Integrations<br>📌 Location: Settings &gt; AI &amp; Integrations<br><br>✅ User Can:<br><br>Enter OpenAI API Key.<br>Connect GitHub Repo (OAuth or Token).<br>Enable Auto-Fetch from VS Code, Notion, Google Drive.<br>Set AI Access Rules (e.g., Allow AI to modify docs?).<br>🔧 Database Table: integration_settings<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE integration_settings (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>integration_name TEXT NOT NULL,<br>api_key TEXT NOT NULL,<br>is_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>✅ Implement API endpoints for documentation storage &amp; retrieval.<br>✅ Build a simple settings page to manage AI API &amp; integrations.<br>✅ Set up GitHub/VS Code sync for fetching docs automatically.<br><br>Would you like mockups or wireframes for the settings page? 📐</p><p></p>', 'task_type': 'Epic', 'priority': None, 'epic_priority': None, 'is_archived': False, 'completed': False, 'parent_id': None, 'project_id': 6, 'project': 'PMS - Backlog', 'contributor_id': 5, 'assigned_to': 'Fredrik Cederborg', 'estimate_type': 'story_points', 'estimate': 42, 'status': 'Not Started', 'sort_order': 1, 'created_at': '2025-02-27T23:02:31.274292', 'updated_at': '2025-03-10T17:29:52.790851', 'contributor_name': 'Fredrik Cederborg', 'parent': None}

Maybe use frameworks like user story mapping<br><br>3. Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1.

Allow AI to read the tasks<br><br><br>This is a great initiative that will systematize and automate the process of turning feature ideas into well-structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks). Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...)

Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints? (Launch dates, dependencies, etc.)<br>💡 Expected AI Output<br>Using these questions, AI should generate:<br><br>✅ Epics (High-level objectives)<br>✅ User Stories (Breaking down the work for users)<br>✅ Subtasks (Actionable development steps)<br>This structured input ensures AI can create high-quality, actionable PBIs instead of vague tasks.<br><br>🚀 Step 2: Wireframes - Full Page UI for AI Refinement<br>I’ll create Figma wireframes showcasing the full-page AI refinement process with:<br><br>Dropdown Combobox (Headless UI) to select an existing PBI.<br>AI-Powered Refinement Page (Clarifying Questions + PBI Generation).<br>Buttons to Open &amp; Edit PBIs in the System.<br>🔹 Let me generate the wireframes and share them with you shortly. 🚀<br><br>🚀 Step 3: Fixed Questions First, Dynamic Later<br>✅ We’ll start with fixed questions (predefined in the UI) to keep the process structured. ✅ If we later need more intelligent, adaptive AI prompts, we can introduce dynamic question generation.<br><br>🎯 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ I\'ll generate and share the Figma wireframes.<br>2️⃣ Once we have UI approval, we’ll define the API &amp; database structure.<br>3️⃣ Then, we move to implementation 🚀.<br><br>Let me work on the wireframes now! 🎨📌<br><br>You said:<br>A lot of the questions in step 1 could be answered by giving the AI access to technical doccumentation. <br>If the AI doesn´t find the answer there, then the question should be asked. <br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a fantastic approach! 🚀 By leveraging technical documentation, we can reduce user input fatigue and ensure AI-generated PBIs are as accurate as possible.<br><br>🔹 Refining the AI Questioning Process<br>Instead of blindly asking all 25+ questions, we will implement a smart, two-step process:<br><br>Step 1: Auto-Extract Answers from Technical Documentation<br>📌 Before asking the user anything, AI will try to find the answer from:<br><br>Project’s API Documentation (Endpoints, models, authentication, rate limits).<br>Database Schema (Relationships, constraints, existing data models).<br>Project’s Vision &amp; Goals (Product strategy, company objectives).<br>Past User Stories &amp; Epics (Ensuring consistency with previous PBIs).<br>Best Practices &amp; Key Learnings (Mistakes to avoid, past development issues).<br>Step 2: Ask Only the Unanswered Questions<br>📌 If AI can’t find an answer, it will only ask the missing information.<br><br>For example:<br><br>If API docs specify affected endpoints, AI skips “Which endpoints will be impacted?”<br>If the database schema reveals relationships, AI skips “What data models are involved?”<br>If a past User Story addressed similar issues, AI suggests improvements instead of asking from scratch.<br>🔹 UX Implementation: Full-Page AI Refinement Flow<br>✅ Step 1: User selects or creates a PBI.<br>✅ Step 2: AI scans project documentation for answers.<br>✅ Step 3: AI generates PBIs, showing:<br><br>🔹 Pre-filled answers from documentation.<br>🔹 Questions only for missing details.<br>✅ Step 4: User reviews &amp; refines before submitting.<br>This ensures: 🚀 Less manual input → AI handles most of the work.<br>🚀 More accurate PBIs → AI cross-checks against existing docs.<br>🚀 Faster process → Users answer only what AI can’t infer.<br><br>🔹 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes – I’ll create the UX flow for AI refinement.<br>2️⃣ Technical Documentation Strategy – We define:<br><br>📌 Where &amp; how AI should access project documentation.<br>📌 Which docs are needed for different PBI types.<br>3️⃣ Implementation Plan – Define how AI extracts, processes &amp; asks questions.<br>Would you like me to proceed with wireframes first or technical documentation strategy first? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>AI Estimation is the next thing we should include, so don´t bother asking the user for that.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Got it! 🚀 AI will automatically estimate Story Points instead of asking the user.<br><br>🔹 How AI Will Estimate Story Points<br>Instead of manually entering estimates, AI will calculate complexity, effort, and uncertainty based on:<br><br>1️⃣ Complexity Analysis<br><br>Database impact → Does it involve schema changes? Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great!

One section of the summary is a list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. Those should be appended to a complete list of key takeaways for future development.<br><br>Every time we create epics, user stories and subtasks for a new feature we should check them against this checklist of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2.

Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1. Create Epics, User stories and subtasks from a refined feature request.<br>2. Script them into the database of autoagile<br>3. Allow AI to read the tasks<br><br><br>This is a great initiative that will systematize and automate the process of turning feature ideas into well-structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks). Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...) "<br>Grant Secure Database Access<br><br>Custom GPT must be allowed to execute database operations securely.<br>We need a secure connection with proper authentication.<br>Ensure Query Execution is Reliable<br><br>Add error handling to prevent duplicate or incorrect entries.<br>Test &amp; Verify Data Submission<br><br>Run test cases to confirm PBIs are structured correctly in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ No External API Required → Runs fully within the GPT model’s environment.<br>✅ Faster Development → No need for external API setup.<br>✅ Tighter Integration with AI → AI can validate &amp; refine PBIs before submission.<br>✅ More Secure → Data never leaves the controlled environment.<br><br>2️⃣ Using OpenAI’s API for External Integration<br>If you prefer a fully programmatic approach, you can call OpenAI’s API from your backend and integrate it with your project management tool.<br><br>✅ How It Works<br>Your backend sends a request to OpenAI’s API, asking it to generate PBIs.<br>OpenAI’s API returns structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, Subtasks).<br>Your system validates the PBIs before inserting them into the database.<br>Your frontend retrieves and displays the PBIs in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of OpenAI’s API Approach<br>✅ More Customization → You control prompts, data structure, and validation.<br>✅ Can Run in the Background → Ideal for scheduled task automation.<br>✅ Scales Better → Works well for large teams &amp; real-time AI interactions.<br><br>🔷 Which Approach Should You Use?<br>🔹 If you want a fast, no-setup solution, go with Custom GPT Actions.<br>🔹 If you need more control, background processing, or external API calls, use OpenAI’s API.<br><br>🚀 Would you like help setting up a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs?<br><br>You said:<br>There is a price difference, right?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Yes, there is a price difference between using Custom GPT Actions and OpenAI’s API integration. Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints?

Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great! I’ll now create Figma wireframes incorporating the AI Estimation Flow into the Task Refinement Page.<br><br>📌 Wireframe Features<br>🔹 Full-Page AI Refinement UI (instead of a modal)<br>🔹 Dropdown Combobox for Selecting a PBI (Headless UI)<br>🔹 Structured Form-Based AI Q&amp;A for refinement<br>🔹 Story Points Section:<br><br>Shows AI-estimated points with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override (switching to "User Edited")<br>I’ll generate the wireframes now! 🚀 Stay tuned. 🎨<br><br><br>Here is the wireframe for the AI-powered task refinement page! 🎨<br><br>Key Features in the Wireframe:<br>✅ Full-page layout for refining PBIs<br>✅ Dropdown combobox with search functionality to select a PBI<br>✅ AI-driven structured form where AI asks questions and users respond<br>✅ Story Points Estimation section:<br><br>Shows AI-generated values with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override, switching to a "User Edited" label<br>Would you like any modifications before we move forward with implementation? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Can you provide a text based UI description instead?<br>I just need the different components of the page that is needed and then I can do layout and design myself.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>AI-Powered Task Refinement Page - UI Structure<br>This page provides a structured interface for refining PBIs with AI assistance.

Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...)

Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints? (Launch dates, dependencies, etc.)<br>💡 Expected AI Output<br>Using these questions, AI should generate:<br><br>✅ Epics (High-level objectives)<br>✅ User Stories (Breaking down the work for users)<br>✅ Subtasks (Actionable development steps)<br>This structured input ensures AI can create high-quality, actionable PBIs instead of vague tasks.<br><br>🚀 Step 2: Wireframes - Full Page UI for AI Refinement<br>I’ll create Figma wireframes showcasing the full-page AI refinement process with:<br><br>Dropdown Combobox (Headless UI) to select an existing PBI.<br>AI-Powered Refinement Page (Clarifying Questions + PBI Generation).<br>Buttons to Open &amp; Edit PBIs in the System.<br>🔹 Let me generate the wireframes and share them with you shortly. 🚀<br><br>🚀 Step 3: Fixed Questions First, Dynamic Later<br>✅ We’ll start with fixed questions (predefined in the UI) to keep the process structured. ✅ If we later need more intelligent, adaptive AI prompts, we can introduce dynamic question generation.<br><br>🎯 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ I\'ll generate and share the Figma wireframes.<br>2️⃣ Once we have UI approval, we’ll define the API &amp; database structure.<br>3️⃣ Then, we move to implementation 🚀.<br><br>Let me work on the wireframes now! 🎨📌<br><br>You said:<br>A lot of the questions in step 1 could be answered by giving the AI access to technical doccumentation. <br>If the AI doesn´t find the answer there, then the question should be asked. <br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a fantastic approach! 🚀 By leveraging technical documentation, we can reduce user input fatigue and ensure AI-generated PBIs are as accurate as possible.<br><br>🔹 Refining the AI Questioning Process<br>Instead of blindly asking all 25+ questions, we will implement a smart, two-step process:<br><br>Step 1: Auto-Extract Answers from Technical Documentation<br>📌 Before asking the user anything, AI will try to find the answer from:<br><br>Project’s API Documentation (Endpoints, models, authentication, rate limits).<br>Database Schema (Relationships, constraints, existing data models).<br>Project’s Vision &amp; Goals (Product strategy, company objectives).<br>Past User Stories &amp; Epics (Ensuring consistency with previous PBIs).<br>Best Practices &amp; Key Learnings (Mistakes to avoid, past development issues).<br>Step 2: Ask Only the Unanswered Questions<br>📌 If AI can’t find an answer, it will only ask the missing information.<br><br>For example:<br><br>If API docs specify affected endpoints, AI skips “Which endpoints will be impacted?”<br>If the database schema reveals relationships, AI skips “What data models are involved?”<br>If a past User Story addressed similar issues, AI suggests improvements instead of asking from scratch.<br>🔹 UX Implementation: Full-Page AI Refinement Flow<br>✅ Step 1: User selects or creates a PBI.<br>✅ Step 2: AI scans project documentation for answers.<br>✅ Step 3: AI generates PBIs, showing:<br><br>🔹 Pre-filled answers from documentation.<br>🔹 Questions only for missing details.<br>✅ Step 4: User reviews &amp; refines before submitting.<br>This ensures: 🚀 Less manual input → AI handles most of the work.<br>🚀 More accurate PBIs → AI cross-checks against existing docs.<br>🚀 Faster process → Users answer only what AI can’t infer.<br><br>🔹 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes – I’ll create the UX flow for AI refinement.<br>2️⃣ Technical Documentation Strategy – We define:<br><br>📌 Where &amp; how AI should access project documentation.<br>📌 Which docs are needed for different PBI types.<br>3️⃣ Implementation Plan – Define how AI extracts, processes &amp; asks questions.<br>Would you like me to proceed with wireframes first or technical documentation strategy first? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>AI Estimation is the next thing we should include, so don´t bother asking the user for that.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Got it! 🚀 AI will automatically estimate Story Points instead of asking the user.<br><br>🔹 How AI Will Estimate Story Points<br>Instead of manually entering estimates, AI will calculate complexity, effort, and uncertainty based on:<br><br>1️⃣ Complexity Analysis<br><br>Database impact → Does it involve schema changes? Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great!

One section of the summary is a list of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. Those should be appended to a complete list of key takeaways for future development.<br><br>Every time we create epics, user stories and subtasks for a new feature we should check them against this checklist of key learnings &amp; takeaways for future development. We can then include reminder notes about this in the tasks they are relevant for. This way we will reduce repeating mistakes, be aware of technical considerations we have to adhere to etc..<br><br>2.

Any other ideas for increasing quality. <br><br>## Estimation:<br><br>I have also asked you to estimate the complexity of the tasks using story points. <br><br>### We have used this framework for estimation:<br><br>We estimate tasks using **story points** with the **Fibonacci scale** (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) That allows us to gauge the **complexity, effort, and uncertainty** associated with each task.<br><br>GPT (You) will assess every feature based on:<br><br>1. **Complexity**: How difficult the task is (e.g., architecture, database relationships, etc.).<br>2. **Effort**: How much time and effort will be required to code, test, and debug.<br>3. **Uncertainty**: Any unknowns or potential challenges (e.g., interacting with new parts of the system, external factors).<br><br>### **Benchmarking**:<br><br>To give context to these estimates:<br><br>- **1-2 Points**: Minor changes like renaming variables, small bug fixes.<br>- **3-5 Points**: Moderate tasks, involving some new logic, minor database changes, and testing.<br>- **8+ Points**: More complex tasks, like introducing new models, changing relationships in the database, or modifying core app logic with potential unknowns.<br><br>### Typical output for a user story:<br><br>🟢 User Story 1: Implement Parent Task Dropdown in Task Modal<br>As a user, I want to assign or change a parent task directly from the task modal, so that I can organize my tasks efficiently.<br><br>✅ Acceptance Criteria:<br><br>A dropdown appears in the task modal, listing all valid parent tasks.<br>Prevents selection of circular dependencies.<br>Updates the parent task dynamically upon selection.<br>Displays correct hierarchy after updates.<br>📌 Estimation: 5 Story Points<br><br>Complexity: Moderate – Needs task filtering, validation logic, and UI integration.<br>Effort: Moderate – Requires API calls, handling UI state, and testing.<br>Uncertainty: Low – We understand the task relationships well.<br><br><br>This is all a part of a larger idea about how to streamline and improve the quality of the entire product development lifecycle and development process.<br><br>## MVP version<br>I´ve been trying to figure out what would be the most valuable step to start building a feature for.<br><br>I think it is a feature that will allow you (AI) to submit these PBI´s into the backlog of my project management tool and then be able to read them back from the tool.<br><br>So the first draft of the feature would be to create a function that can take a PBI and submit it to the db of the project management tool.<br><br>## Version 2:<br>Next step would be to create a function that can read the PBIs from the db and return them as a list.<br><br>## Version 3<br>To take the whole process of refining a simple feature idea or request into more detailed and actionable PBI´s and integrate it into the project management tool.<br><br>### This would involve the following requirements:<br>- It needs to be a guided process, not just an inline chat.<br>- Both the user and the AI should follow the process.<br><br>To be further discussed....<br>I have a documented ideas in this notion file:<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4">https://www.notion.so/lacunamedia/Automating-task-creation-in-autoagile-191979257fc08007a001c3c2dc0a773f?pvs=4</a><br><br>## The development process:<br>Generating code for the feature based on the PBI´s.<br>The process of you (AI) and me coding together is a process of it´s own that we are working on a plan for optimizing. <br>See separate document: \'optimizing_our_development_process.md\' <br><br><br><br>How can we automate the whole process of:<br><br>1. Create Epics, User stories and subtasks from a refined feature request.<br>2. Script them into the database of autoagile<br>3. Allow AI to read the tasks<br><br><br>This is a great initiative that will systematize and automate the process of turning feature ideas into well-structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks). Below is a structured approach to refining and implementing this system.<br><br>📌 Summary of the Planned Process<br>We are aiming to automate the workflow of refining a feature request into actionable PBIs and integrating them directly into the project management tool. The long-term vision is to ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in product development.<br><br>🚀 Proposed Steps for Automating AI-Driven PBI Creation<br>1️⃣ Create Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks from a Refined Feature Request<br>🔹 Step 1: Validate PBIs Against "Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways"<br><br>After every session, we capture Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways for future development.<br>When generating new PBIs, we cross-check them against this checklist.<br>If relevant, reminder notes are added to tasks (e.g., “Avoid X issue seen in past development”).<br>✅ Benefit: Prevent repeated mistakes, ensure technical consistency.<br><br>🔹 Step 2: Use Frameworks to Improve PBI Quality<br><br>User Story Mapping: Break down the feature based on user journeys.<br>Impact Mapping: Understand the business &amp; user impact.<br>Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD): Define tasks based on what the user is trying to achieve.<br>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios: Define Acceptance Criteria in a structured format.<br>✅ Benefit: Increases clarity, prioritization, and alignment with user goals.<br><br>🔹 Step 3: Automate AI-Driven PBI Generation<br><br>AI takes a high-level feature request and breaks it down into Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI adds relevant acceptance criteria and ensures no conflicting dependencies.<br>User can review &amp; refine before submitting to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Reduces manual effort, ensures consistency.<br><br>2️⃣ Submit PBIs to the AutoAgile Database<br>🔹 Step 4: Create API for AI to Submit PBIs<br><br>A POST API endpoint will allow AI to write PBIs into the project management system.<br>AI will assign metadata (e.g., priority, estimated effort, dependencies).<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures a structured backlog instead of scattered notes.<br><br>3️⃣ Allow AI to Read and Retrieve PBIs<br>🔹 Step 5: Create API to Fetch PBIs<br><br>A GET API endpoint will allow AI to retrieve PBIs from the database.<br>This enables PBI iteration, tracking, and refinement.<br>✅ Benefit: AI can refine &amp; adjust PBIs dynamically over time.<br><br>4️⃣ Version 3: Full AI-Driven PBI Refinement Process<br>🔹 Step 6: Create a Guided Process for PBI Refinement Instead of an inline chat, we build a structured UI to guide both the user and AI in refining PBIs.<br><br>Step 1: User provides initial feature request.<br>Step 2: AI asks clarifying questions (e.g., “Is this a new feature or an improvement?”).<br>Step 3: AI generates Epics, User Stories &amp; Subtasks.<br>Step 4: AI applies learnings from past development.<br>Step 5: User reviews &amp; refines before finalizing.<br>Step 6: PBIs are submitted to the backlog.<br>✅ Benefit: Ensures high-quality PBIs while keeping the user in control.<br><br>🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan<br>Phase 1 (MVP)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create a POST /api/pbis endpoint to submit PBIs.<br>Store PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Simple form UI for submitting PBIs.<br>Allow users to review &amp; edit before submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI generates PBIs using structured templates.<br>AI checks against the Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways.<br>Phase 2 (API Retrieval)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Create GET /api/pbis to fetch PBIs.<br>Support filtering by status, priority, and dependencies.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog.<br>Allow users to edit, refine &amp; iterate on PBIs.<br>Phase 3 (Full AI-Driven Workflow)<br>✔ Backend:<br><br>Implement AI-powered iterative refinement.<br>Store AI-generated clarifying questions &amp; user responses.<br>✔ Frontend:<br><br>Guided multi-step process for refining PBIs.<br>Interactive user review step before final submission.<br>✔ AI Integration:<br><br>AI actively asks clarifying questions before generating PBIs.<br>AI learns from past PBIs and Key Learnings to improve over time.<br>📌 Key Benefits of This System<br>✅ Automates repetitive work → AI breaks down features into PBIs.<br>✅ Ensures higher quality PBIs → AI cross-checks with Key Learnings.<br>✅ Prevents dependency issues → AI validates task relationships.<br>✅ Creates a structured backlog → PBIs are stored systematically.<br>✅ Streamlines estimation → AI assigns story points based on complexity.<br>✅ Saves developer time → Faster iteration &amp; execution of product features.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>🚀 Would you like to start with Phase 1 (Submitting PBIs to the database)?<br>Or do you want to explore UI/UX ideas for the guided process first?<br><br>You said:<br>Does this require an integration to for example OpenAI´s API or is it possible to create an Action in a custom GPT and when triggering that action the PBI´s are submitted to the db? <br>ChatGPT said:<br>It does not necessarily require OpenAI’s API integration if we use Custom GPT Actions. Here’s how both approaches would work:<br><br>1️⃣ Using Custom GPT Actions (No API Integration Needed)<br>✅ How It Works<br>Instead of calling an external API, we can define an Action in a Custom GPT that directly interacts with the database.<br><br>Trigger the Action<br><br>You (the user) initiate a request:<br>"Generate PBIs for the new feature and submit them to the backlog."<br>AI Generates PBIs<br><br>Based on the feature description, the AI structures Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>AI assigns story points, dependencies, and priority.<br>AI Executes the Action<br><br>The Custom GPT Action runs, submitting the generated PBIs directly into the project management tool’s database.<br>Confirmation &amp; Review<br><br>The system can return a confirmation message:<br>"PBIs have been submitted. Would you like to refine them further?"<br>✅ What’s Needed to Implement This?<br>Define a Custom GPT Action<br><br>The Action should be configured to execute a database query.<br>Example: "INSERT INTO pbis (title, description, type, priority, estimated_points) VALUES (...) "<br>Grant Secure Database Access<br><br>Custom GPT must be allowed to execute database operations securely.<br>We need a secure connection with proper authentication.<br>Ensure Query Execution is Reliable<br><br>Add error handling to prevent duplicate or incorrect entries.<br>Test &amp; Verify Data Submission<br><br>Run test cases to confirm PBIs are structured correctly in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ No External API Required → Runs fully within the GPT model’s environment.<br>✅ Faster Development → No need for external API setup.<br>✅ Tighter Integration with AI → AI can validate &amp; refine PBIs before submission.<br>✅ More Secure → Data never leaves the controlled environment.<br><br>2️⃣ Using OpenAI’s API for External Integration<br>If you prefer a fully programmatic approach, you can call OpenAI’s API from your backend and integrate it with your project management tool.<br><br>✅ How It Works<br>Your backend sends a request to OpenAI’s API, asking it to generate PBIs.<br>OpenAI’s API returns structured PBIs (Epics, User Stories, Subtasks).<br>Your system validates the PBIs before inserting them into the database.<br>Your frontend retrieves and displays the PBIs in the backlog.<br>🔥 Pros of OpenAI’s API Approach<br>✅ More Customization → You control prompts, data structure, and validation.<br>✅ Can Run in the Background → Ideal for scheduled task automation.<br>✅ Scales Better → Works well for large teams &amp; real-time AI interactions.<br><br>🔷 Which Approach Should You Use?<br>🔹 If you want a fast, no-setup solution, go with Custom GPT Actions.<br>🔹 If you need more control, background processing, or external API calls, use OpenAI’s API.<br><br>🚀 Would you like help setting up a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs?<br><br>You said:<br>There is a price difference, right?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Yes, there is a price difference between using Custom GPT Actions and OpenAI’s API integration. Here’s the breakdown:<br><br>💰 Cost of Using Custom GPT Actions<br>✅ Free (if using within ChatGPT Pro)<br>✅ No additional API costs<br>✅ No per-token billing<br><br>Why?<br>Custom GPT Actions run within ChatGPT’s existing infrastructure. OpenAI doesn’t charge per request for actions, but you must be on a ChatGPT Pro plan ($20/month).<br><br>However, if the Action connects to an external database or service that has costs (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Supabase, etc.), you’ll still need to pay for that separately.<br><br>💰 Cost of Using OpenAI’s API<br>❌ Pay-per-use pricing<br>✅ Costs depend on model + token usage<br><br>Current API Pricing (as of 2024)<br>Model Input (per 1K tokens) Output (per 1K tokens)<br>GPT-4-turbo $0.01 $0.03<br>GPT-4 $0.03 $0.06<br>GPT-3.5-turbo $0.0015 $0.002<br>Estimated API Cost for PBI Generation<br>If generating 5-10 PBIs at a time, a request might use 500-1000 tokens.<br>Cost per request: $0.005 - $0.02 (GPT-4-turbo)<br>If you generate PBIs 100 times per day:<br>GPT-4-turbo: ~$0.50 - $2/day<br>GPT-4: ~$1.50 - $6/day<br>GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.15 - $0.40/day<br>Additional Costs<br>Database storage: If using Firebase, AWS, or another DB, there may be small storage costs.<br>API Requests: If your project management tool has an API, it may have rate limits or extra costs.<br>Which is Cheaper?<br>If you already use ChatGPT Pro → Custom GPT Actions = FREE<br>No additional API costs.<br>Ideal if you just need to generate &amp; submit PBIs without extra complexity.<br>If you need external processing → OpenAI API = Paid (but scalable)<br>More expensive, but fully customizable.<br>Better if you want background processing, bulk PBI creation, or integrations.<br>🚀 Best Recommendation?<br>If you’re cost-conscious and just need basic PBI creation &amp; submission, start with Custom GPT Actions (free).<br><br>If you later need scalability, automation, and background AI processing, you can move to OpenAI’s API.<br><br>Would you like help defining a Custom GPT Action for submitting PBIs? 🔥<br><br>You said:<br>I want to do both but start with the API integration because I think that is what will evolve into a valuable feature with the possibilities for controlling the process and integrating it into the UI of our project management app.<br>It would be great to have the GPT action a backup for keeping costs down.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That sounds like a great strategy! 🎯<br>By starting with API integration, you can fully control the process, customize it to fit the UI of your project management app, and enable deeper automation.<br><br>Later, implementing a Custom GPT Action as a backup will allow on-demand PBI creation while keeping costs down for smaller use cases.<br><br>✅ Step-by-Step Plan for API Integration<br>We\'ll start by integrating OpenAI’s API to generate PBIs and store them in your project management tool’s database.<br><br>Phase 1: API-Based PBI Submission<br>1️⃣ Define API Endpoints<br><br>POST /api/pbis → Accepts AI-generated PBIs and stores them in the database.<br>GET /api/pbis → Retrieves PBIs from the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Implement AI-Powered PBI Generation<br><br>Use OpenAI’s API (GPT-4-turbo) to generate Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>Apply Key Learnings &amp; Takeaways from past development.<br>3️⃣ Store PBIs in the Project Management Tool<br><br>Save PBIs in the AutoAgile database.<br>Attach metadata like priority, dependencies, and estimation.<br>4️⃣ Expose PBIs in the UI<br><br>Display PBIs in the backlog inside your Next.js app.<br>Allow user review &amp; refinement before finalizing.<br>Phase 2: Backup Solution - Custom GPT Action<br>If API costs become high, allow users to manually trigger a GPT Action to generate PBIs without API calls.<br><br>1️⃣ Create a Custom GPT Action<br><br>Action: generate_pbIs(feature_description: str) → JSON<br>Returns structured PBIs to be manually entered into the backlog.<br>2️⃣ Integrate with Your UI<br><br>Offer an option like "Generate PBIs via GPT" in the UI.<br>If API usage is high, fallback to GPT Action instead of API calls.<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>Would you like to:<br>1️⃣ Start defining the OpenAI API integration (set up endpoints, API calls)?<br>2️⃣ Set up the Custom GPT Action as a backup?<br>3️⃣ Plan both in parallel and create a roadmap?<br><br>You said:<br>Not yet. First:<br>1. I want us to discuss how it would be inplemented in the UI and provide the optimal UX.<br>2. Could we benefit from drafting the architecture, sequence diagrams, user flows?<br>3. Before we start coding, I want you to create PBI´s for the project and estimate complexity.<br>4. Create psql commands for creating the PBI´s.<br><br>Lets go through these steps one by one.<br><br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a solid structured approach! 🚀<br>By focusing on UX, architecture, planning, and PBI creation before coding, we’ll ensure a smooth implementation with fewer rewrites.<br><br>📌 Step 1: UI &amp; UX Discussion<br>Before implementing API-based PBI generation, we need to design how users will interact with it inside the Project Management System (PMS).<br><br>🎯 Key UX Considerations<br><br>✅ Where Should PBI Creation Happen?<br><br>Inside the Backlog View? (Best for structured planning)<br>Inside a Feature Request modal? (Good for quick task creation)<br>As a standalone "AI Assistant" panel? (Best for guided AI interaction)<br><br>✅ What Input Does the AI Need?<br><br>- Free-text Feature Description (User types in an idea)<br><br>- Structured Input (e.g., dropdowns for project, priority, complexity)<br><br>- Existing Tasks as Context (AI refines based on project backlog)<br><br>If we would start the process by asking the user to select item(s) from the backlog or create a new PBI, then we could keep the original feature idea/request and have the entire history saved.<br><br>I think the process should run the following way:<br>1. The user selects an item from the backlog or creates a new one.<br>2. AI asks a series of questions to gather more information about the feature, the goals, what problem it will solve, the expected outcome, etc..<br>Also, I think the AI would benefit from having access to the project’s history, the project’s goals, the project’s vision, the technical documentation.<br>We have to discuss what questions the AI should ask and how the user should input the answers.<br><br>✅ How Should the Output Be Handled?<br>Yes - Inline Editing: User sees generated PBIs and edits them before submission.<br>No - One-Click Submit: AI submits PBIs automatically.<br>Yes - Step-by-Step Refinement: AI asks clarifying questions before finalizing.<br><br>✅ Should the User See a Live Preview?<br>Yes → A real-time preview of the PBIs as the AI generates them.<br>No → AI generates them first, then the user reviews before submission.<br><br>✅ How Will Users Trigger AI PBI Generation?<br>Yes - Button → "Generate PBIs from Feature Request"<br>Maybe - Shortcut Command → /generate_pbi &lt;feature&gt;<br>No - Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to generate PBIs<br><br>Instead of 3: Automated Suggestion → When a new feature is created, AI offers to help with refining the feature request and informs the user about the possibility of generating PBIs and what the feature request should include to make it easier for the AI to generate relevant PBIs.<br><br><br>📌 Suggested UI Flows<br><br>## Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User navigates to the Backlog View.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>5. AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks.<br>6. User reviews and edits before submitting.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Integrated into existing planning workflow.<br>Structured &amp; controlled task creation.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Requires users to be inside the backlog to use AI.<br><br>## Option 2: Feature Request Modal with AI Assistance<br>💡 Best for Users Adding New Ideas 1️⃣ User opens Feature Request modal.<br>2️⃣ Enters high-level feature description.<br>3️⃣ Clicks “Generate PBIs” → AI suggests tasks.<br>4️⃣ User reviews, edits, and approves.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br><br>Works naturally when defining new features.<br>Faster workflow for brainstorming ideas.<br>❌ Cons<br><br>Might lack full backlog context when generating PBIs.<br><br>## Option 3: Dedicated AI Assistant Panel<br>💡 Best for Advanced AI-Driven Planning 1️⃣ User opens an “AI Assistant” panel.<br>2️⃣ AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br>3️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>4️⃣ User modifies or approves PBIs.<br>5️⃣ PBIs are automatically pushed to the backlog.<br><br>✅ Pros<br>More structured, guided PBI refinement.<br>AI helps users refine vague ideas into structured tasks.<br><br>❌ Cons<br>More complex UI to implement.<br><br>I´m leaning towards option 1 with the added step 4. AI asks clarifying questions about the feature.<br><br>🚀 What’s Next?<br>1️⃣ Which UI flow do you prefer (Backlog, Feature Request Modal, AI Assistant)?<br>2️⃣ Would you like wireframes/mockups before moving to architecture diagrams?<br><br>See my answers in the list above:<br><br>That’s a fantastic refinement of the process! The form-based approach for AI clarifying questions makes a lot of sense. It improves UX efficiency and keeps the process structured, ensuring users don\'t feel overwhelmed by an open-ended conversation.<br><br>📌 Finalized UI/UX Approach<br>✅ Option 1: AI-Powered Backlog View (with Clarifying Questions &amp; Form Input)<br>💡 Best for Teams Who Plan in Sprints 1️⃣ User selects an existing item from the backlog or creates a new feature request.<br>2️⃣ Clicks “+ AI Generate PBIs” → A modal opens.<br>3️⃣ User inputs a feature description and selects project, priority, estimation strategy.<br>4️⃣ AI presents clarifying questions in a form UI (instead of free-text chat).<br>5️⃣ User fills in answers in structured fields → This data is stored for future reference.<br>6️⃣ AI generates Epics, User Stories, and Subtasks dynamically.<br>7️⃣ User reviews and edits before submitting PBIs to the backlog.<br><br>🚀 Why This Works Best<br>✅ Keeps the original feature request history → Tracks context properly.<br>✅ AI doesn’t rely on unstructured responses → User inputs structured answers via the form.<br>✅ Faster, structured refinement process → Reduces ambiguity in AI-generated PBIs.<br>✅ Guided yet flexible → AI only asks for details when necessary (conditional logic in the form).<br>✅ More efficient user experience → No need to manually structure long text responses.<br><br>📌 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Define the AI Clarifying Questions for the Form<br>We need to list the essential clarifying questions AI should ask. Some of these will be always required, and others will be conditional (depending on the feature type, project, etc.).<br><br>Example questions:<br><br>What problem does this feature solve? (Always required)<br>Who is the primary user? (Required for user-facing features)<br>What is the expected outcome? (Always required)<br>Are there existing related tasks or dependencies? (Optional)<br>Does this feature impact security or performance? (Conditional: Only if related to infrastructure)<br>Would you like me to draft a complete list of questions based on best practices?<br><br>2️⃣ Create Wireframes for the Modal<br>Since we’re using a form-based approach instead of a chat-like UI, we should create wireframes for:<br><br>The initial “AI Generate PBIs” modal<br>The form layout for clarifying questions<br>The final PBI preview screen<br>Do you want Figma wireframes or a quick text-based UI flow first?<br><br>3️⃣ Technical Considerations<br>Would you like the AI-generated clarifying questions to be:<br><br>Fixed (predefined in the UI)? → Simpler, but less flexible.<br>Dynamically generated (AI decides what to ask)? → More flexible, but requires more logic.<br>🚀 Let’s finalize these details so we can move into architecture and implementation!<br><br><br>You said:<br>1. draft a complete list of questions based on best practices + what you consider being valuable to be able to provide the best quality PBI´s.<br><br>2. I think it should be a separate full page instead of a modal. <br>On that page user should be able to select a PBI from a dropdown combobox with search functionality.<br>(We are using headless UI combobox for the parent task selector)<br>From each PBI, the user should be able to click a button to open that PBI on the AI refinement page.<br><br>If you can provide figma wireframes that would be fantastic.<br><br>3. Let´s start with the fixed questions, and then maybe add dynamically generated if needed.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>🚀 Step 1: Complete List of AI Clarifying Questions for High-Quality PBIs<br>The goal is to ensure AI-generated PBIs are highly structured, relevant, and actionable. Below is a best-practice-based question framework that balances user intent, technical feasibility, and product strategy.<br><br>🟢 General Questions (Always Required)<br>What problem does this feature solve? (User’s pain point, why it’s needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>🟡 Questions Based on Feature Type<br>🔹 For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>🔹 For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>🔹 For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>🔹 For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>What’s the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms → 100ms)<br>🟠 Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented? (Feature flags, migrations, etc.)<br>Does it require collaboration across teams? (Design, DevOps, Security, etc.)<br>Are there known risks or potential blockers? (Legacy code dependencies, technical debt, etc.)<br>🟣 Estimation &amp; Prioritization<br>What is the priority level? (Critical, High, Medium, Low)<br>What’s the estimated impact? (Revenue, user retention, operational efficiency)<br>Are there any deadlines or time-sensitive constraints?

Complex relationships?<br>API impact → Are new endpoints needed? Major refactoring required?<br>Frontend impact → Is it a UI change or deep business logic?<br>Security concerns → Are there authentication/authorization risks?<br>2️⃣ Effort Calculation<br><br>Lines of code (LOC) prediction → Based on past PBIs of similar scope.<br>Number of components affected → More files = higher effort.<br>Testing needs → How much unit &amp; integration testing is required?<br>3️⃣ Uncertainty Rating<br><br>Does the AI find enough documentation?<br>Does this feature require new technology?<br>Does the feature involve high unknowns (e.g., 3rd party integrations)?<br>📌 Estimation Output (Fibonacci Scale) AI will output a story point estimate (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) with reasoning:<br><br>🟢 Low Complexity → 1-3 Points<br>🟡 Moderate Complexity → 5-8 Points<br>🔴 High Complexity &amp; Unknowns → 13+ Points<br>🔹 Next Steps<br>1️⃣ Figma Wireframes (Integrate AI estimation in UI).<br>2️⃣ Define Estimation Algorithm (How AI calculates effort).<br>3️⃣ Implement AI Estimation API (Story Point prediction).<br><br>Where should AI show the estimated Story Points?<br><br>Inside the PBI form? (User sees it before submission).<br>Only in the backlog? (After PBI is saved).<br>Let me know, and I’ll include it in the wireframes! 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>I want the AI estimation included in the task description and currently all tasks have a field for estimation where user can enter story points, instead of adding another field for AI estimate I´m thinking we could indicate if estimation is set by AI or if it is human edited. What do you think?<br>ChatGPT said:<br>That’s a great approach! It keeps the UI clean while still allowing users to see whether the estimate was AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 How to Implement AI Estimation in the Task Description<br>1️⃣ Story Points Field Behavior:<br><br>AI auto-generates an initial estimate when a PBI is created.<br>The user can edit the estimate manually if they disagree.<br>If the user changes the AI estimate, we mark it as human-edited.<br>2️⃣ Indicating AI vs. Human Estimates:<br><br>AI-generated estimate → Display a small "AI" badge next to the number.<br>User-edited estimate → Display a "User Edited" label (or remove the AI badge).<br>3️⃣ Example UI Representations:<br><br>AI Estimate: Story Points: 5 (AI)<br>User-Edited: Story Points: 8 (User Edited)<br>🔹 Backend &amp; Database Changes<br>Keep the existing story_points field.<br><br>Add a new field: is_ai_estimate (true/false)<br><br>true → AI-generated<br>false → Manually overridden<br>When AI sets the estimate, is_ai_estimate = true.<br><br>If a user changes the estimate, set is_ai_estimate = false.<br><br>🔹 User Flow<br>1️⃣ AI suggests an estimate when the PBI is created.<br>2️⃣ User can keep it or edit it.<br>3️⃣ If edited, it switches from AI to user-edited.<br>4️⃣ The UI reflects whether the estimate is AI-generated or manually adjusted.<br><br>🔹 Advantages of This Approach<br>✅ Minimal UI clutter – No extra fields.<br>✅ Users stay in control – AI assists but doesn’t dictate.<br>✅ Clear distinction between AI-generated &amp; human-set values.<br>✅ Easy implementation – Just an extra is_ai_estimate field.<br><br>Next Steps<br>🔹 Update PBI Creation Flow to auto-assign AI estimates.<br>🔹 Modify UI to display AI/User-edited status.<br>🔹 Ensure API updates is_ai_estimate correctly.<br><br>Would you like this logic to be included in the Figma wireframes? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Yes<br>ChatGPT said:<br>Great! I’ll now create Figma wireframes incorporating the AI Estimation Flow into the Task Refinement Page.<br><br>📌 Wireframe Features<br>🔹 Full-Page AI Refinement UI (instead of a modal)<br>🔹 Dropdown Combobox for Selecting a PBI (Headless UI)<br>🔹 Structured Form-Based AI Q&amp;A for refinement<br>🔹 Story Points Section:<br><br>Shows AI-estimated points with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override (switching to "User Edited")<br>I’ll generate the wireframes now! 🚀 Stay tuned. 🎨<br><br><br>Here is the wireframe for the AI-powered task refinement page! 🎨<br><br>Key Features in the Wireframe:<br>✅ Full-page layout for refining PBIs<br>✅ Dropdown combobox with search functionality to select a PBI<br>✅ AI-driven structured form where AI asks questions and users respond<br>✅ Story Points Estimation section:<br><br>Shows AI-generated values with an "AI" badge<br>Allows manual override, switching to a "User Edited" label<br>Would you like any modifications before we move forward with implementation? 🚀<br><br>You said:<br>Can you provide a text based UI description instead?<br>I just need the different components of the page that is needed and then I can do layout and design myself.<br>ChatGPT said:<br>AI-Powered Task Refinement Page - UI Structure<br>This page provides a structured interface for refining PBIs with AI assistance.

Below is the plan:<br><br>1️⃣ Where Should We Store Documentation?<br>Option 1: PostgreSQL (Best for Structured Documentation)<br>Store documentation as text in a dedicated table.<br>Allows version control and easy retrieval.<br>Can be indexed for faster AI retrieval.<br>Table: project_documentation<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE project_documentation (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,<br>title TEXT NOT NULL,<br>content TEXT NOT NULL,<br>source TEXT DEFAULT \'Manual Upload\',<br>uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>AI can efficiently search and extract relevant details.<br>Allows tagging &amp; filtering by source (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, Manual Upload).<br>Option 2: External File Storage (Best for Large Documents)<br>Store Markdown, TXT, or PDF files in an S3 bucket (AWS, Firebase, etc.).<br>Only metadata is stored in PostgreSQL.<br>AI retrieves and processes the files when needed.<br>Table: documentation_files<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE documentation_files (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>project_id INT REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,<br>file_url TEXT NOT NULL,<br>file_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (file_type IN (\'md\', \'txt\', \'pdf\')),<br>uploaded_by INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>Supports larger documents that may not fit in PostgreSQL.<br>Allows manual file uploads and auto-fetching from integrations.<br>2️⃣ Where in the UI Should the User Upload Documentation?<br>📂 Dedicated "Documentation Management" Page (Settings)<br>Location: Inside Settings &gt; Documentation.<br>Features:<br>Upload Markdown, TXT, PDF files.<br>View &amp; Edit existing documentation.<br>Connect integrations (GitHub, VS Code, Notion, etc.).<br>Configure AI access permissions for each document.<br>3️⃣ Automatic Documentation Retrieval<br>✅ Can We Integrate with GitHub, VS Code, or Notion?<br>Yes! We can fetch project documentation automatically from these sources:<br><br>Integration Method Use Case<br>GitHub Fetch .md files via API Pull documentation from repos<br>VS Code Read local .md files Sync local project docs<br>Notion API connection Import structured docs<br>Google Drive API connection Fetch shared project docs<br>📡 Example: GitHub API Integration<br>Fetch .md documentation from a GitHub repo:<br><br>python<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>import requests<br><br>GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_personal_token"<br>REPO_OWNER = "your_username"<br>REPO_NAME = "your_project"<br><br>url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{REPO_OWNER}/{REPO_NAME}/contents/docs"<br>headers = {"Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}"}<br><br>response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)<br>files = response.json()<br><br>for file in files:<br>if file["name"].endswith(".md"):<br>doc_content = requests.get(file["download_url"]).text<br>print("Fetched Documentation:", doc_content)<br>✅ Pros:<br><br>Automatically syncs up-to-date documentation from GitHub.<br>AI can use repo docs before asking the user for details.<br>4️⃣ Simple Settings Page for AI API &amp; Integrations<br>📌 Location: Settings &gt; AI &amp; Integrations<br><br>✅ User Can:<br><br>Enter OpenAI API Key.<br>Connect GitHub Repo (OAuth or Token).<br>Enable Auto-Fetch from VS Code, Notion, Google Drive.<br>Set AI Access Rules (e.g., Allow AI to modify docs?).<br>🔧 Database Table: integration_settings<br>sql<br>Copy<br>Edit<br>CREATE TABLE integration_settings (<br>id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,<br>user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),<br>integration_name TEXT NOT NULL,<br>api_key TEXT NOT NULL,<br>is_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,<br>created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP<br>);<br>🚀 Next Steps<br>✅ Implement API endpoints for documentation storage &amp; retrieval.<br>✅ Build a simple settings page to manage AI API &amp; integrations.<br>✅ Set up GitHub/VS Code sync for fetching docs automatically.<br><br>Would you like mockups or wireframes for the settings page? 📐</p><p></p>', 'task_type': 'Epic', 'priority': None, 'epic_priority': None, 'is_archived': False, 'completed': False, 'parent_id': None, 'project_id': 6, 'project': 'PMS - Backlog', 'contributor_id': 5, 'assigned_to': 'Fredrik Cederborg', 'estimate_type': 'story_points', 'estimate': 42, 'status': 'Not Started', 'sort_order': 1, 'created_at': '2025-02-27T23:02:31.274292', 'updated_at': '2025-03-10T17:29:52.790851', 'contributor_name': 'Fredrik Cederborg', 'parent': None}

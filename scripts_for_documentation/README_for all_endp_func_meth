Recommendations to further enhance this resource:

	1.	Add Module Descriptions:
	•	For each file, include a brief description of its purpose. This helps readers quickly understand the module’s role without needing to dig into the code.
	2.	[X]Include Docstrings:
	•	If available, pull the first line of the docstring for each function, method, or class to provide context about its behavior.
	3.	Highlight HTTP Endpoints:
	•	Group and clearly mark HTTP endpoints separately, possibly categorizing them into GET, POST, PUT, etc.
	4.	Organize Classes with Methods:
	•	Indent methods under their respective classes to make the relationship clearer.
	5.	Add File Structure Context:
	•	Before listing the content of each file, indicate its directory location relative to the project root (you are already doing this but adding context to the hierarchy could help).
	6.	Identify Duplicates:
	•	Analyze for duplicate function names across different modules, as it might signal refactoring opportunities.
	7.	Interactive Version:
	•	Consider creating an HTML or markdown version of this overview for easy navigation and linking between sections.
	8.	Add Usage Metrics (Optional):
	•	If feasible, annotate functions or endpoints with their usage frequency (e.g., from logs or tests), indicating how critical they are.
	9.	Error-Prone Areas:
	•	Highlight functions or classes with known issues or frequent changes to bring immediate attention to hotspots.
	10.	Group Testing Functions:
	•	Segregate tests from main application code for clarity, possibly listing them under a separate “Testing” heading.

 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.

 * The functions provided by this module are used to communicate certain properties

 * the current execution in different rendering modes such as pre-rendering, resuming, and SSR.
 *
 * Today Next.js treats all code as potentially static. Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.
 * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts
 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.

 *
 * Today Next.js treats all code as potentially static. Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.
 * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts
 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.

 *
 * Today Next.js treats all code as potentially static. Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.
 * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts
 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.

 *
 * Today Next.js treats all code as potentially static. Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.
 * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts
 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.

 * Today Next.js treats all code as potentially static. Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.
 * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts
 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.

 *
 * Today Next.js treats all code as potentially static. Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.
 * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts
 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.

    // Eg you can't have pages/[post]/abc.js and pages/[hello]/something-else.js
    // Only 1 dynamic segment per nesting level
    // So in the case that is test/integration/dynamic-routing it'll be this:
    // pages/[post]/comments.js
    // pages/blog/[post]/comment/[id].js
    // Both are fine because `pages/[post]` and `pages/blog` are on the same level
    // So in this case `UrlNode` created here has `this.slugName === 'post'`
    // And since your PR passed through `slugName` as an array basically it'd including it in too many possibilities

    // ATTENTION
    // We never remove these associations.
    // It's OK to reference families, but use WeakMap/Set for types.
    // This WeakMap is read by React, so we only put families
    // that have actually been edited here. This keeps checks fast.
    // $FlowIssue
    // This is cleared on every performReactRefresh() call.
    // It is an array of [Family, NextType] tuples.
    // This is injected by the renderer via DevTools global hook.
    // We keep track of mounted roots so we can schedule updates.
    // If a root captures an error, we remember it so we can retry on edit.
    // In environments that support WeakMap, we also remember the last element for every root.
    // It needs to be weak because we do this even for roots that failed to mount.
    // If there is no WeakMap, we won't attempt to do retrying.
    // $FlowIssue
    // This can happen in an edge case, e.g. if expression like Foo.useSomething
    // depends on Foo which is lazily initialized during rendering.
    // In that case just assume we'll have to remount.
    // Something's wrong. Assume we need to remount.
    // Only check updated types to keep lookups fast.
    // If we didn't care about IE11, we could use new Map/Set(iterable).
    // This is a safety mechanism to protect against rogue getters and Proxies.
    // Intentionally ignore.
    // Now that we got a real edit, we can create associations
    // that will be read by the React reconciler.
    // Determine whether this should be a re-render or a re-mount.
    // TODO: rename these fields to something more meaningful.
    // Families that will re-render preserving state
    // Families that will be remounted
    // Even if there are no roots, set the handler on first update.
    // This ensures that if *new* roots are mounted, they'll use the resolve handler.
    // We snapshot maps and sets that are mutated during commits.
    // If we don't do this, there is a risk they will be mutated while
    // we iterate over them. For example, trying to recover a failed root
    // may cause another root to be added to the failed list -- an infinite loop.

    // It captures Hook list at that time so inline requires don't break comparisons.
    // For React Native, the global hook will be set up by require('react-devtools-core').
    // That code will run before us. So we need to monkeypatch functions on existing hook.
    // For React Web, the global hook will be set up by the extension.
    // This will also run before us.
    // However, if there is no DevTools extension, we'll need to set up the global hook ourselves.
    // Note that in this case it's important that renderer code runs *after* this method call.
    // Otherwise, the renderer will think that there is no global hook, and won't do the injection.
    // This isn't a real property on the hook, but it can be set to opt out
    // of DevTools integration and associated warnings and logs.

    // This includes intentionally scheduled unmounts.
    // We need to determine whether this root has just (un)mounted.
    // This logic is copy-pasted from similar logic in the DevTools backend.

 * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of
 * Dynamic indications.
 *
 * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where
 * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it
 * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever
 * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside
 * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.
 *
 * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic
 * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside
 * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should
 * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.

    // indicator. However when we pass this proxy to our Promise.resolve() below the VM checks if the resolved value is a promise by looking
    // at the `.then` property. To our dynamic tracking logic this is indistinguishable from a `then` searchParam and so we would normally trigger
    // dynamic tracking. However we know that this .then is not real dynamic access, it's just how thenables resolve in sequence. So we introduce
    // this initialization concept so we omit the dynamic check until after we've constructed our resolved promise.
    // We don't use makeResolvedReactPromise here because searchParams
    // supports copying with spread and we don't want to unnecessarily
    // instrument the promise with spreadable properties of ReactPromise.
    // These properties cannot be shadowed because they need to be the
    // true underlying value for Promises to work correctly at runtime
    // We are accessing a property that doesn't exist on the promise nor

    // ATTENTION
    // We never remove these associations.
    // It's OK to reference families, but use WeakMap/Set for types.
    // This WeakMap is read by React, so we only put families
    // that have actually been edited here. This keeps checks fast.
    // $FlowIssue
    // This is cleared on every performReactRefresh() call.
    // It is an array of [Family, NextType] tuples.
    // This is injected by the renderer via DevTools global hook.
    // We keep track of mounted roots so we can schedule updates.
    // If a root captures an error, we remember it so we can retry on edit.
    // In environments that support WeakMap, we also remember the last element for every root.
    // It needs to be weak because we do this even for roots that failed to mount.
    // If there is no WeakMap, we won't attempt to do retrying.
    // $FlowIssue
    // This can happen in an edge case, e.g. if expression like Foo.useSomething
    // depends on Foo which is lazily initialized during rendering.
    // In that case just assume we'll have to remount.
    // Something's wrong. Assume we need to remount.
    // Only check updated types to keep lookups fast.
    // If we didn't care about IE11, we could use new Map/Set(iterable).
    // This is a safety mechanism to protect against rogue getters and Proxies.
    // Intentionally ignore.
    // Now that we got a real edit, we can create associations
    // that will be read by the React reconciler.
    // Determine whether this should be a re-render or a re-mount.
    // TODO: rename these fields to something more meaningful.
    // Families that will re-render preserving state
    // Families that will be remounted
    // Even if there are no roots, set the handler on first update.
    // This ensures that if *new* roots are mounted, they'll use the resolve handler.
    // We snapshot maps and sets that are mutated during commits.
    // If we don't do this, there is a risk they will be mutated while
    // we iterate over them. For example, trying to recover a failed root
    // may cause another root to be added to the failed list -- an infinite loop.
    // Keep trying other roots.
    // Keep trying other roots.
    // This can happen in an edge case, e.g. if we register
    // return value of a HOC but it returns a cached component.
    // Ignore anything but the first registration for each type.
    // Create family or remember to update it.
    // None of this bookkeeping affects reconciliation
    // until the first performReactRefresh() call above.
    // Visit inner types because we might not have registered them.
    // Visit inner types because we might not have signed them.
    // This is lazily called during first render for a type.
    // It captures Hook list at that time so inline requires don't break comparisons.
    // For React Native, the global hook will be set up by require('react-devtools-core').
    // That code will run before us. So we need to monkeypatch functions on existing hook.
    // For React Web, the global hook will be set up by the extension.
    // This will also run before us.
    // However, if there is no DevTools extension, we'll need to set up the global hook ourselves.
    // Note that in this case it's important that renderer code runs *after* this method call.
    // Otherwise, the renderer will think that there is no global hook, and won't do the injection.
    // This isn't a real property on the hook, but it can be set to opt out
    // of DevTools integration and associated warnings and logs.
    // Using console['warn'] to evade Babel and ESLint
    // Here, we just want to get a reference to scheduleRefresh.
    // This version supports React Refresh.
    // Do the same for any already injected roots.
    // This is useful if ReactDOM has already been initialized.
    // https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17626
    // This version supports React Refresh.
    // We also want to track currently mounted roots.
    // If it was intentionally scheduled, don't attempt to restore.
    // This includes intentionally scheduled unmounts.
    // We need to determine whether this root has just (un)mounted.
    // This logic is copy-pasted from similar logic in the DevTools backend.
    // If this breaks with some refactoring, you'll want to update DevTools too.
    // Mount a new root.
    // Unmount an existing root.
    // We'll remount it on future edits.
    // We'll remount it on future edits.
    // Mount a new root.
    // Always call the decorated DevTools hook.
    // TODO: delete this after removing dependency in RN.
    // Exposed for testing.
    // This is a wrapper over more primitive functions for setting signature.
    // Signatures let us decide whether the Hook order has changed on refresh.
    //
    // This function is intended to be used as a transform target, e.g.:
    // var _s = createSignatureFunctionForTransform()
    //
    // function Hello() {
    //   const [foo, setFoo] = useState(0);
    //   const value = useCustomHook();
    //   _s(); /* Call without arguments triggers collecting the custom Hook list.
    //          * This doesn't happen during the module evaluation because we
    //          * don't want to change the module order with inline requires.
    //          * Next calls are noops. */
    //   return <h1>Hi</h1>;
    // }
    //
    // /* Call with arguments attaches the signature to the type: */
    // _s(
    //   Hello,
    //   'useState{[foo, setFoo]}(0)',
    //   () => [useCustomHook], /* Lazy to avoid triggering inline requires */
    // );
    // We're in the initial phase that associates signatures
    // with the functions. Note this may be called multiple times
    // in HOC chains like _s(hoc1(_s(hoc2(_s(actualFunction))))).
    // We're in the innermost call, so this is the actual type.
    // Set the signature for all types (even wrappers!) in case
    // they have no signatures of their own. This is to prevent
    // problems like https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20417.
    // We're in the _s() call without arguments, which means
    // this is the time to collect custom Hook signatures.
    // Only do this once. This path is hot and runs *inside* every render!
    // First, deal with classes.
    // React class.
    // This looks like a class.
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-proto
    // It has a superclass.
    // Pass through.
    // This looks like a regular function with empty prototype.
    // For plain functions and arrows, use name as a heuristic.
    // Definitely React components.

    // ATTENTION
    // We never remove these associations.
    // It's OK to reference families, but use WeakMap/Set for types.
    // This WeakMap is read by React, so we only put families
    // that have actually been edited here. This keeps checks fast.
    // $FlowIssue
    // This is cleared on every performReactRefresh() call.
    // It is an array of [Family, NextType] tuples.
    // This is injected by the renderer via DevTools global hook.
    // We keep track of mounted roots so we can schedule updates.
    // If a root captures an error, we remember it so we can retry on edit.
    // In environments that support WeakMap, we also remember the last element for every root.
    // It needs to be weak because we do this even for roots that failed to mount.
    // If there is no WeakMap, we won't attempt to do retrying.
    // $FlowIssue
    // This can happen in an edge case, e.g. if expression like Foo.useSomething
    // depends on Foo which is lazily initialized during rendering.
    // In that case just assume we'll have to remount.
    // Something's wrong. Assume we need to remount.
    // Only check updated types to keep lookups fast.
    // If we didn't care about IE11, we could use new Map/Set(iterable).
    // This is a safety mechanism to protect against rogue getters and Proxies.
    // Intentionally ignore.
    // Now that we got a real edit, we can create associations
    // that will be read by the React reconciler.
    // Determine whether this should be a re-render or a re-mount.
    // TODO: rename these fields to something more meaningful.
    // Families that will re-render preserving state
    // Families that will be remounted
    // Even if there are no roots, set the handler on first update.
    // This ensures that if *new* roots are mounted, they'll use the resolve handler.
    // We snapshot maps and sets that are mutated during commits.
    // If we don't do this, there is a risk they will be mutated while
    // we iterate over them. For example, trying to recover a failed root
    // may cause another root to be added to the failed list -- an infinite loop.
    // Keep trying other roots.
    // Keep trying other roots.
    // This can happen in an edge case, e.g. if we register
    // return value of a HOC but it returns a cached component.
    // Ignore anything but the first registration for each type.
    // Create family or remember to update it.
    // None of this bookkeeping affects reconciliation
    // until the first performReactRefresh() call above.
    // Visit inner types because we might not have registered them.
    // Visit inner types because we might not have signed them.
    // This is lazily called during first render for a type.
    // It captures Hook list at that time so inline requires don't break comparisons.
    // For React Native, the global hook will be set up by require('react-devtools-core').
    // That code will run before us. So we need to monkeypatch functions on existing hook.
    // For React Web, the global hook will be set up by the extension.
    // This will also run before us.
    // However, if there is no DevTools extension, we'll need to set up the global hook ourselves.
    // Note that in this case it's important that renderer code runs *after* this method call.
    // Otherwise, the renderer will think that there is no global hook, and won't do the injection.
    // This isn't a real property on the hook, but it can be set to opt out
    // of DevTools integration and associated warnings and logs.
    // Using console['warn'] to evade Babel and ESLint
    // Here, we just want to get a reference to scheduleRefresh.
    // This version supports React Refresh.
    // Do the same for any already injected roots.
    // This is useful if ReactDOM has already been initialized.
    // https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/17626
    // This version supports React Refresh.
    // We also want to track currently mounted roots.
    // If it was intentionally scheduled, don't attempt to restore.
    // This includes intentionally scheduled unmounts.
    // We need to determine whether this root has just (un)mounted.
    // This logic is copy-pasted from similar logic in the DevTools backend.
    // If this breaks with some refactoring, you'll want to update DevTools too.
    // Mount a new root.
    // Unmount an existing root.
    // We'll remount it on future edits.
    // We'll remount it on future edits.

    // This is a wrapper over more primitive functions for setting signature.
    // Signatures let us decide whether the Hook order has changed on refresh.

    // This function is intended to be used as a transform target, e.g.:
    // var _s = createSignatureFunctionForTransform()
    //
    // function Hello() {

    //   const value = useCustomHook();
    //   _s(); /* Call without arguments triggers collecting the custom Hook list.
    //          * This doesn't happen during the module evaluation because we
    //          * don't want to change the module order with inline requires.
    //          * Next calls are noops. */

    //   'useState{[foo, setFoo]}(0)',
    //   () => [useCustomHook], /* Lazy to avoid triggering inline requires */
    // );
    // We're in the initial phase that associates signatures
    // with the functions. Note this may be called multiple times
    // in HOC chains like _s(hoc1(_s(hoc2(_s(actualFunction))))).
    // We're in the innermost call, so this is the actual type.
    // Set the signature for all types (even wrappers!) in case
    // they have no signatures of their own. This is to prevent
    // problems like https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20417.
    // We're in the _s() call without arguments, which means
    // this is the time to collect custom Hook signatures.
    // Only do this once. This path is hot and runs *inside* every render!
    // First, deal with classes.
    // React class.
    // This looks like a class.
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-proto
    // It has a superclass.
    // Pass through.
    // This looks like a regular function with empty prototype.
    // For plain functions and arrows, use name as a heuristic.
    // Definitely React components.

    // elements with a positive tabIndex:
    //   Elements that have identical tabIndexes should be navigated in the order they appear.
    //   Navigation proceeds from the lowest tabIndex to the highest tabIndex.
    // NOTE: sort implementation may be unstable and thus mess up DOM order,
    // that's why we build a map that's being sorted instead. If we were able to rely
    // on a stable sorting algorithm, sortTabindex() could be as simple as
    // elements.sort(function(a, b) { return a.tabIndex - b.tabIndex; });
    // at this time Chrome does not use a stable sorting algorithm
    // see http://blog.rodneyrehm.de/archives/14-Sorting-Were-Doing-It-Wrong.html#stability
    // NOTE: compareDocumentPosition seemed like more overhead than just sorting this with buckets

    // extract elements that don't need sorting
    // create sortable bucket for dom-order-preservation of elements with the same tabIndex
    // maintain a list of unique tabIndexes
    // sort element into the proper bucket
    // element moved to sorting map, so not "normal" anymore
    // sort the tabindex ascending,
    // then resolve them to their appropriate buckets,
    // then flatten the array of arrays to an array
    // Some browsers sort <area> in DOM order, some place the <area>s

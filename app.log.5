Instead:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Use open-source LLMs like GPT-4-All, Mistral, or Ollama</strong> instead of Tiptap AI.</p></li><li><p><strong>Host AI models yourself</strong> with Hugging Face models or OpenAI API proxies.</p></li></ul><p><strong>💰 Potential Savings</strong>: No per-token AI fees.</p><hr><h2><strong>4️⃣ Optimize Frontend Performance</strong></h2><p>Tiptap loads many dependencies, which <strong>increase bundle size</strong>. Reduce costs by:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lazy-loading extensions</strong> (only load features users need).</p></li><li><p><strong>Tree-shaking unused dependencies</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using a CDN</strong> to serve assets (reduces direct server load).</p></li></ul><p><strong>💰 Potential Savings</strong>: Lower hosting and bandwidth costs.</p><hr><h2><strong>5️⃣ Alternative Open-Source Editors (If You Outgrow Tiptap)</strong></h2><p>If Tiptap costs <strong>too much</strong>, you can consider:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lexical (by Meta)</strong> – Free, ultra-lightweight, great for scaling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slate.js</strong> – Flexible and customizable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quill.js</strong> – Good for simpler use cases.</p></li></ul><hr><h3><strong>📌 Final Takeaway</strong></h3><p>If you’re using <strong>Tiptap for rich text only</strong>, it’s free.<br>But if you <strong>need real-time collaboration, AI, or cloud services</strong>, follow these tips to <strong>reduce costs</strong> and <strong>scale efficiently</strong>.</p><p>Would you like help setting up <strong>self-hosted Hocuspocus</strong> or <strong>AI alternatives</strong>? 🚀</p>', 'task_type': 'User Story', 'priority': 'Unset', 'epic_priority': None, 'is_archived': False, 'completed': False, 'parent_id': 393, 'project_id': 7, 'project': 'PMS - Feature Requests', 'contributor_id': None, 'assigned_to': 'Unassigned', 'estimate_type': 'story_points', 'estimate': 0, 'status': 'Not Started', 'sort_order': 5, 'created_at': '2025-03-06T17:47:24.265914', 'updated_at': '2025-03-13T12:58:04.098431', 'contributor_name': 'Unassigned', 'parent': {'id': 393, 'name': 'List of ideas for new features, parameters to add', 'description': '<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br><br></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>', 'task_type': 'Epic', 'priority': None, 'epic_priority': 'P0', 'is_archived': False, 'completed': False, 'parent_id': None, 'project_id': 7, 'project': 'PMS - Feature Requests', 'contributor_id': 5, 'assigned_to': 'Fredrik Cederborg', 'estimate_type': 'story_points', 'estimate': 0, 'status': 'Not Started', 'sort_order': 0, 'created_at': '2025-03-04T22:30:26.587511', 'updated_at': '2025-03-09T00:44:40.457003'}}

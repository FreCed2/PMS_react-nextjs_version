(Userâs pain point, why itâs needed)<br>What is the expected outcome or benefit? (How success is measured)<br>Who is the primary user? (Developers, admins, end-users, etc.)<br>What should the AI avoid when generating PBIs? (Redundant features, conflicting solutions, etc.)<br>Does this relate to an existing Epic or User Story? (Ensures PBIs are linked to relevant work)<br>ð¡ Questions Based on Feature Type<br>ð¹ For UI/UX Features<br>What are the key UI components or interactions?<br>Should it follow an existing design system? (Yes/No - If yes, specify the system)<br>Are there any accessibility considerations? (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.)<br>ð¹ For Backend/API Features<br>Which services, endpoints, or database models will be impacted?<br>Are there security concerns (authentication, authorization, sensitive data)?<br>Does it require performance optimizations (caching, async processing, etc.)?<br>ð¹ For Automation or AI-Powered Features<br>Should the system make automatic decisions, or require human approval?<br>What are the key inputs and outputs?<br>Are there ethical concerns with automation (bias, transparency, etc.)?<br>ð¹ For Integrations<br>Which external service(s) will this integrate with?<br>Are there API rate limits or other constraints?<br>Should the system sync data in real-time or on a schedule?<br>ð¹ For Performance-Related Features<br>What is the current bottleneck? (DB queries, large payloads, front-end rendering, etc.)<br>Whatâs the performance expectation? (e.g., Reduce response time from 500ms â 100ms)<br>ð  Workflow &amp; Dependencies<br>Are there any preconditions before this can be implemented?
